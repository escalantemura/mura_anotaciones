    Species with more complex behaviors have brains with more neurons that
    are available for behavior, learning, remembering, reasoning, and making
    plans. Primate brains—especially large ones—contain many more neurons
    per gram than rodent brains and many more neurons in the cortex.

<p>Today, we know the adult brain forms connections between the cells in
  the brain, called neurons, throughout a lifetime. This change in
  understanding about the brain has been met with optimism and excitement.
  Therapies for brain injury and mental illness have been developed based
  on understanding about lifelong brain changes. Dozens of researchers are
  also making new discoveries every year about neurogenesis, the
  generation of new neurons.</p>
<h2>Primary function of nervous
  system</h2>
<p>When we ask our students what they think the ultimate function of the
  brain is, they often say “thinking,” or “logical reasoning,” or
  “perceiving,” or “remembering things.”
  <mark class="highlight4">The nervous system does perform
    these functions, but they support the primary one: control of
    movement.
  </mark>
  (Note that movement includes speech and other forms of
  communication, an important category of human behavior.) The basic
  function of perception is to inform us of what is happening in our
  environment so that our behaviors will be adaptive and useful:
  Perception without the ability to act would be useless. Once perceptual
  abilities evolved, they could be used for purposes other than guiding
  behavior.

<h2>Blood-brain barrier</h2>
<p>The blood–brain barrier is not uniform throughout the nervous system.
  <mark class="highlight1">In several places the barrier is
    relatively permeable, allowing substances that are excluded elsewhere to
    cross freely. For example, the area postrema is a part of the brain that
    controls vomiting. The blood–brain barrier is much weaker there,
    permitting neurons in this region to detect the presence of toxic
    substances in the blood.
  </mark>
  (A barrier around the area postrema
  prevents substances from diffusing from this region into the rest of the
  brain.) A poison that enters the circulatory system from the stomach can
  thus stimulate the area postrema to initiate vomiting. If the organism
  is lucky, the poison can be expelled from the stomach before causing too
  much damage.

    Brain development begins during the prenatal period and extends through
    adulthood.
  </footer>
</figure>
<p>The ventricular zone gives rise to more neurons than are needed. In
  fact, these neurons must compete to survive. The axons of approximately
  50 percent of these neurons do not find vacant postsynaptic cells of the
  right type with which to form synaptic connections, so they die by
  apoptosis. This phenomenon (sometimes called “pruning”), too, involves a
  chemical signal; when a presynaptic neuron establishes synaptic
  connections, it receives a signal from the postsynaptic cell that
  permits it to survive. The neurons that come too late do not find any
  available space and therefore do not receive this life-sustaining
  signal. This scheme might seem wasteful, but apparently the evolutionary
  process found that the safest strategy was to produce too many neurons
  and let them fight to establish synaptic connections rather than trying
  to produce exactly the right number of each type of neuron.</p>
<h2>Brain development and
  neurogenesis</h2>
<p>As Rakic notes, each symmetrical division doubles the number of
  progenitor cells and thus doubles the size of the brain. The human brain
  is 10 times larger than that of a rhesus macaque monkey. Thus, between
  three and four additional symmetrical divisions of progenitor cells
  would account for the difference in the size of these two brains. In
  fact, the stage of symmetrical division lasts about two days longer in
  humans, which provides enough time for three more divisions. The period
  of asymmetrical division is longer, too, which accounts for the fact
  that the human cortex is 15 percent thicker. Thus, delays in the
  termination of the symmetrical and asymmetrical periods of development
  could be responsible for the increased size of the human brain. A few
  simple mutations of the genes that control the timing of brain
  development could be responsible for these delays</p>
<p>Brain development continues after an animal is born. In fact,
  <mark class="highlight1">the human brain continues to
    develop for at least two decades
  </mark>
  , and subtle changes—for example
  those produced by learning experiences—continue to occur throughout
  life. (See Figures 3.9 and 3.10)
</p>
<p>As we will see later in this chapter, different regions of the
  cerebral cortex perform specialized functions. Some receive and analyze
  visual information, some receive and analyze auditory information, some
  control movement of the muscles, and so on. Thus, different regions
  receive different inputs, contain different types of circuits of
  neurons, and have different outputs.
  <mark class="highlight2">What factors control this pattern
    of development? The primary factors are genetics, personal experience,
    and a process known as neurogenesis.
  </mark>
</p>
<p>Experience also affects brain development. For example, one cue for
  depth perception arises from the fact that each eye gets a slightly
  different view of the world (Poggio &amp; Poggio, 1984). This form of
  depth perception, stereopsis, is the kind obtained from a stereoscope or
  a three-dimensional movie. The particular neural circuits that are
  necessary for stereopsis, which are located in the cerebral cortex, will
  not develop unless an infant has experience viewing objects with both
  eyes during a critical period early in life.
  <mark class="highlight4">If an infant’s eyes do not move
    together properly—if they are not directed toward the same place in the
    environment (that is, if the eyes are “crossed”)—the infant never
    develops stereoscopic vision, even if the eye movements are later
    corrected by surgery on the eye muscles. This critical period occurs
    sometime between one and three years of age
  </mark>
  (Banks et al., 1975).
</p>
<p>Similar phenomena have been studied in laboratory animals and have
  confirmed that sensory input affects the connections established between
  cortical neurons. Evidence indicates that a certain amount of neural
  rewiring can be accomplished even in the adult brain. For example, after
  a person’s arm has been amputated, the region of the cerebral cortex
  that previously analyzed sensory information from the missing limb soon
  begins analyzing information from adjacent regions of the body, such as
  the stump of the arm, the trunk, or the face. In fact, the person
  becomes more sensitive to touch in these regions after the changes in
  the cortex take place (Elbert et al., 1994; Kew et al., 1994; Yang et
  al., 1994).</p>
<p>In addition,
  <mark class="highlight1">musicians who play
    stringed instruments have a larger cortical region devoted to analysis
    of sensory information from the fingers of the left hand (which they use
    to press the strings)
  </mark>
  , and when a blind person who can read
  Braille touches objects with his or her fingertips, an enlarged region
  of the cerebral cortex is activated (Elbert et al., 1995; Sadato et al.,
  1996). For many years, researchers believed that neurogenesis—
  production of new neurons—could not take place in the fully developed
  brain. However, many studies have shown this belief to be incorrect—the
  adult brain contains some stem cells (similar to the progenitor cells
  that give rise to the cells of the developing brain) that can divide and
  produce neurons. Detection of newly produced cells is done by
  administering a small amount of a radioactive form of one of the
  nucleotide bases that cells use to produce the DNA that is needed for
  neurogenesis. The next day, the animals’ brains are removed and examined
  with methods described in Chapter 5.
</p>
<p>Such studies have found evidence for neurogenesis in two parts of the
  adult brain: the hippocampus, primarily involved in learning, and the
  olfactory bulb, involved in the sense of smell (Doetsch &amp; Hen,
  2005).
  <mark class="highlight1">Evidence indicates that
    exposure to new odors can increase the survival rate of new neurons in
    the olfactory bulbs, and training on a learning task can enhance
    neurogenesis in the hippocampus.
  </mark>
  (See Figure 3.11.) Chapter 13
  has more to say about the role of neurogenesis in learning. In addition,
  as we will see in Chapter 16,
  <mark class="highlight4">depression or exposure to stress
    can suppress neurogenesis in the hippocampus, and drugs that reduce
    stress and depression can reinstate neurogenesis
  </mark>
  . Unfortunately,
  there is no evidence that growth of new neurons can repair the effects
  of brain damage, such as that caused by head injury or strokes.

<p>Just as regions of the sensory association cortex of the posterior
  part of the brain are involved in perceiving and remembering, the
  frontal association cortex is involved in the planning and execution of
  movements. The motor association cortex (also known as the premotor
  cortex) is located just rostral to the primary motor cortex. This region
  controls the primary motor cortex; thus, it directly controls behavior.
  If the primary motor cortex is the keyboard of the piano, then the motor
  association cortex is the piano player. The rest of the frontal lobe,
  rostral to the motor association cortex, is known as the prefrontal
  cortex. This region of the brain is less involved with the control of
  movement and more involved in formulating plans and strategies. (See
  Figure 3.16.)</p>
<p>Although the two cerebral hemispheres cooperate with each other, they
  do not perform identical functions. Some functions are lateralized—
  located primarily on one side of the brain. In general, the left
  hemisphere participates in the analysis of information— the extraction
  of the elements that make up the whole of an experience. This ability
  makes the left hemisphere particularly good at recognizing serial
  events—events whose elements occur one after the other—and controlling
  sequences of behavior. (In a few people, the functions of the left and
  right hemispheres are reversed.)</p>
<p>
  <mark class="highlight1">The serial functions that are
    performed by the left hemisphere include verbal activities, such as
    talking, understanding the speech of other people, reading, and writing.
    These abilities are disrupted by damage to the various regions of the
    left hemisphere. (We will say more about language and the brain in
    Chapter 14.) In contrast, the right hemisphere is specialized for
    synthesis; it is particularly good at putting isolated elements together
    to perceive things as a whole.
  </mark>
  For example, our ability to draw
  sketches (especially of three-dimensional objects), read maps, and
  construct complex objects out of smaller elements depends heavily on
  circuits of neurons that are located in the right hemisphere. Damage to
  the right hemisphere disrupts these abilities.

<p>This definition of a drug also rules out essential nutrients, such as
  proteins, fats, carbohydrates, minerals, and vitamins that are necessary
  constituents of a healthy diet. Finally, it states that drugs are
  effective in low doses. This qualification is important, because large
  quantities of almost any substance—even common ones such as table
  salt—will alter the functions of cells.</p>
<p>As we will see in this chapter, drugs have effects and sites of
  action. Drug effects are the changes we can observe in an individual’s
  physiological processes and behavior. For example, the effects of
  codeine, morphine, and other opiates include decreased sensitivity to
  pain, slowing of the digestive system, sedation, muscular relaxation,
  constriction of the pupils, and at high doses, euphoria. The sites of
  action of drugs are the points at which molecules of drugs interact with
  molecules located on or in cells of the body, thus affecting some
  biochemical processes of these cells. For example, the sites of action
  of the opiates are specialized receptors situated in the membrane of
  some neurons. When molecules of opiates attach to and activate these
  receptors, the drugs alter the activity of these neurons and produce
  their effects. This chapter considers both the effects of drugs and
  their sites of action.</p>

    Pharmacokinetics includes the steps by which drugs are (1) absorbed, (2)
    distributed within the body, (3) metabolized, and (4) excreted. You can
    think of these steps as describing the life cycle of a drug molecule in
    the body. First, drug molecules are absorbed into the body based on how
    they are administered. For example, if a drug is taken orally, it is
    absorbed through the lining of the digestive system. After being
    absorbed, drug molecules are distributed throughout the body by blood in
    the circulatory system, including to the CNS where many sites of action
    are located. At the same time, drug molecules are being metabolized, or
    changed into an inactive form, by enzymes. Most drug metabolizing
    enzymes are located in the liver. Finally, drug molecules are excreted
    and removed from the body, typically by the kidneys.
  </footer>
</figure>
<ul>
  <li>First, let’s consider some of the routes by which drugs can be
    administered. For laboratory animals the most common route is injection.
    The drug is dissolved or suspended in a liquid and injected through a
    hypodermic needle. The fastest route is <strong>intravenous (IV)
      injection</strong>—injection into a vein. The drug is absorbed and
    distributed immediately, reaching the brain within a few seconds. The
    disadvantages of IV injections are the increased care and skill they
    require in comparison to most other forms of injection and the fact that
    the entire dose reaches the bloodstream at once. If an individual is
    especially sensitive to the drug, there may be little time to administer
    another drug to counteract its effects.
  </li>
  <li>An <strong>intraperitoneal (IP) injection</strong> is rapid but not
    as rapid as an IV injection. The drug is injected through the abdominal
    wall into the peritoneal cavity—the space that surrounds the stomach,
    intestines, liver, and other abdominal organs. IP injection is commonly
    used to administer drugs to small laboratory animals.
  </li>
  <li>An <strong>intramuscular (IM) injection</strong> made directly into
    a large muscle, such as those found in the upper arm, thigh, or
    buttocks. The drug is absorbed into the bloodstream through the
    capillaries that supply the muscle. A drug can also be injected into the
    space beneath the skin by means of a subcutaneous (SC) injection.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Oral administration</strong> is the most common form of
    administering therapeutic drugs to humans. Some chemicals cannot be
    administered orally because they are destroyed by stomach acid or
    digestive enzymes or because they are not absorbed from the digestive
    system into the bloodstream. For example, insulin, a peptide hormone,
    must be injected. Sublingual administration of certain drugs can be
    accomplished by placing them beneath the tongue. The drug is absorbed
    into the bloodstream by the capillaries that supply the mucous membrane
    that lines the mouth. Some drugs used to treat migraine headaches are
    administered this way, resulting in faster onset of therapeutic effects
    and less risk of irritating the stomach.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>lungs</strong> provide another route for drug
    administration: inhalation. Nicotine, freebase cocaine, and marijuana
    are inhaled through smoking. In addition, many general anesthetics are
    gases that are administered through inhalation. The route from the lungs
    to the brain is very short, and drugs administered this way have very
    rapid effects.
  </li>
  <li>Some drugs can be absorbed <strong>directly through the
    skin</strong>, so they can be given by means of topical administration.
    Natural or artificial steroid hormones can be administered in this way,
    as can nicotine (as a treatment to make it easier for a person to stop
    smoking). The mucous membrane lining the nasal passages also provides a
    route for topical administration. Commonly abused drugs such as cocaine
    and bath salts are often sniffed so that they come into contact with the
    nasal mucosa. This route delivers the drug to the brain very rapidly.
    The technical, but rarely used name for this route is insufflation. Note
    that sniffing or “snorting” is not the same as inhalation; when powdered
    drugs are sniffed, they enter circulation through the mucous membrane of
    the nasal passages, not the lungs.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>To study the effects of a drug in a specific region of the brain (for
  example, in a particular nucleus of the hypothalamus), a researcher will
  inject a very small amount of the drug directly into the brain. This
  procedure, known as intracerebral administration, is described in more
  detail in Chapter 5. To achieve a widespread distribution of a drug in
  the brain, a researcher will get past the blood–brain barrier by
  injecting the drug into a cerebral ventricle. The drug is then absorbed
  into the brain tissue, where it can exert its effects. This route,
  <strong>intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration</strong>, is used
  very rarely in humans—primarily to deliver antibiotics directly to the
  brain to treat certain types of infections.</p>
<h2>Drug effectiveness</h2>
<figure class="figura">
  <figcaption>A Dose-Response Curve</figcaption>
  <img alt="A Dose-Response Curve" src="../../img/notes/content/physiologyofbehavior-doseresponsecurve.jpg">
  <footer>
    Increasingly higher doses of a drug cause increasingly larger effects
    until the point of maximum effect is reached. At this point, increasing
    the dose of the drug does not produce any more effect
  </footer>
</figure>
<p>Drugs vary widely in their effectiveness. The effects of a small dose
  of a relatively effective drug can equal or exceed the effects of larger
  amounts of a relatively ineffective drug. The best way to measure the
  effectiveness of a drug is to plot a dose-response curve. To do this,
  individuals are given various doses of a drug, usually defined as
  milligrams of drug per kilogram of an individual’s body weight, and the
  effects of the drug are plotted. Because the molecules of most drugs
  distribute themselves throughout the blood and then throughout the rest
  of the body, a heavier individual (human or laboratory animal) will
  require a larger quantity of a drug to achieve the same concentration as
  a smaller quantity will produce in a smaller individual. Increasingly
  higher doses of a drug cause increasingly larger effects until the point
  of maximum effect is reached. At this point, increasing the dose of the
  drug does not produce any more effect.</p>
<p>Most drugs have more than one effect. Opiates such as morphine,
  codeine, or oxycodone produce analgesia (reduced sensitivity to pain),
  but they also depress the activity of neurons in the medulla that
  control heart rate and respiration. A physician who prescribes an opiate
  to relieve a patient’s pain wants to administer a dose that is large
  enough to produce analgesia but not large enough to depress heart rate
  and respiration—effects that could be fatal. Figure 4.5 shows two
  dose-response curves, one for the analgesic effects of morphine and one
  for the drug’s depressant Âeffects on respiration. The difference
  between these curves indicates the drug’s margin of safety. The most
  desirable drugs have a large margin of safety.</p>
<figure class="figura">

    The dose-response curve on the left shows the analgesic effect of
    morphine, and the curve on the right shows one of the drug’s adverse
    side effects: its depressant effect on respiration. A drug’s margin of
    safety is reflected by the difference between the dose-response curve
    for its therapeutic effects and that for its adverse side effects.
  </footer>
</figure>
<h3>Therapeutic index</h3>
<p>One measure of a drug’s margin of safety is its <strong>therapeutic
  index</strong>. This measure is obtained by administering varying doses
  of the drug to a group of laboratory animals or human volunteers. Two
  numbers are obtained: the dose that produces the desired effects in 50
  percent of the individuals and the dose that produces toxic effects in
  50 percent of the individuals. The therapeutic index is the ratio of
  these two numbers. For example, if the toxic dose is five times higher
  than the effective dose, then the therapeutic index is 5.0. The lower
  the therapeutic index, the more care must be taken in prescribing the
  drug. For example, barbiturates are older drugs used to treat anxiety
  and have relatively low therapeutic indexes—as low as 2 or 3. In
  contrast, benzodiazepines such as diazepam (Valium) are considered more
  safe and have therapeutic indexes of well over 100. As a consequence, an
  accidental overdose of a barbiturate is much more likely to have tragic
  effects than a similar overdose of a benzodiazepine. Why do drugs vary
  in their effectiveness? There are two reasons: sites of action and the
  affinity of a drug with its site of action.</p>
<p>First, different drugs—even those that produce the same behavioral
  effects—may have different sites of action. For example, both oxycodone
  (OxyContin) and aspirin have analgesic effects, but oxycodone suppresses
  the activity of neurons in the spinal cord and brain that are involved
  in pain perception, whereas aspirin reduces the production of a chemical
  involved in transmitting information from damaged tissue to
  pain-sensitive neurons. Because the drugs act very differently, a given
  dose of oxycodone produces much more pain reduction than the same dose
  of aspirin does.</p>
<p>The second reason that drugs vary in their effectiveness has to do
  with the affinity of the drug with its site of action. Most drugs of
  interest to psychopharmacologists exert their effects by binding at
  sites of action in the CNS—such as presynaptic or postsynaptic
  receptors, transporter molecules, or by interacting with enzymes
  involved in the production or deactivation of neurotransmitters. Drugs
  vary widely in their affinity—the readiness with which the two molecules
  join together—for the sites to which they attach. A drug with a high
  affinity will produce effects at a relatively low concentration, whereas
  a drug with a low affinity must be administered in higher doses. Thus,
  even two drugs with identical sites of action can vary widely in their
  effectiveness if they have different affinities for their binding sites.
  In addition, because most drugs have multiple effects, a drug can have
  high affinities for some of its sites of action and low affinities for
  others. The most desirable drug has a high</p>
<p>The most important factor that determines the rate at which a drug
  reaches sites of action within the brain is <strong>lipid
    solubility</strong>, or the ability of fat-based molecules to pass
  through cell membranes (see Chapter 2). The blood–brain barrier is a
  barrier only for water-soluble molecules. Molecules that are soluble in
  lipids pass through the cells that line the capillaries in the CNS, and
  they rapidly distribute themselves throughout the brain. For example,
  heroin (diacetylmorphine) is a more lipid soluble drug than morphine.
  Thus, an intravenous injection of heroin produces more rapid effects
  than does one of morphine. Even though the molecules of the two drugs
  are equally effective when they reach their sites of action in the
  brain, the fact that heroin molecules get there faster means that they
  produce a more intense “rush,” and this explains why the abuse potential
  of heroin is greater than that of morphine.</p>

<p>Drugs do not remain in the body indefinitely. Many are metabolized
  and deactivated by enzymes, and all are eventually excreted, primarily
  by the kidneys. The liver plays an especially active role in enzymatic
  deactivation of drugs, but some deactivating enzymes are also found in
  the blood. The brain also contains enzymes that destroy some drugs. In
  some cases, enzymes transform molecules of a drug into other forms that
  themselves are biologically active. Occasionally, the transformed
  molecule is even more active than the one that is administered. In such
  cases the effects of a drug can have a very long duration. For example,
  chlordiazepoxide (Librium) is used to treat symptoms of anxiety. The
  effects of one dose of this drug can last more than 24 hours, in part
  because some of the metabolized molecules are active in the body for
  even longer than the original drug molecule (Greenblatt et al.,
  1981).</p>
<p>affinity for sites of action that produce therapeutic effects and a
  low affinity for sites of action that produce toxic side effects. One of
  the goals of research by drug companies is to find chemicals with just
  this pattern of effects.</p>
<p>
  <mark class="highlight1">Often, when a drug is
    administered repeatedly, its effects do not remain constant. In most
    cases its effects will diminish— a phenomenon known as tolerance. In
    other cases a drug becomes more and more effective—a phenomenon known as
    sensitization
  </mark>
  . Let’s consider tolerance first. Tolerance is seen
  in many drugs that are commonly abused. For example, a person who
  regularly uses heroin must take larger and larger amounts of the drug
  for it to be effective. And once a person has taken heroin regularly
  enough to develop tolerance, that individual will likely experience
  withdrawal symptoms if he or she suddenly stops taking the drug.
  Withdrawal symptoms are primarily the opposite of the effects of the
  drug itself. For example, heroin produces euphoria; withdrawal from it
  produces dysphoria—a feeling of anxious misery.
</p>
<p>Heroin also produces relaxation; withdrawal from it produces
  agitation. <strong>Withdrawal symptoms</strong> are caused by the same
  mechanisms that are responsible for tolerance. Tolerance is the result
  of the body’s attempt to compensate for the effects of the drug. That
  is, most systems of the body, including those controlled by the brain,
  are regulated so that they stay at an optimal value or set point. When
  the effects of a drug alter these systems for a prolonged time,
  compensatory mechanisms begin to produce the opposite reaction, at least
  partially compensating for the disturbance from the optimal value. These
  mechanisms account for the fact that more and more of the drug must be
  taken to achieve a given level of effects. Then, when the person stops
  taking the drug, the compensatory mechanisms make themselves felt as
  withdrawal symptoms, unopposed by the action of the drug. When a person
  has repeatedly used a drug enough to produce withdrawal symptoms when
  they stop using it, they are said to have physical dependence on the
  drug</p>
<p>Research suggests that there are several types of compensatory
  mechanisms that accompany repeated use of a drug. As we will see, many
  drugs that affect the brain do so by binding with receptors and
  activating them. The first compensatory mechanism involves a decrease in
  the effectiveness of such binding. Either the receptors become less
  sensitive to the drug and their affinity for the drug decreases, or the
  receptors decrease in number. The second compensatory mechanism involves
  the process that couples the receptors to ion channels in the membrane
  or to the production of second messengers. After prolonged stimulation
  of the receptors, one or more steps in the coupling process become less
  effective. (Of course, both effects can occur.)</p>
<p>The details of these compensatory mechanisms are described in Chapter
  18, which discusses the causes and effects of substance abuse. Many
  drugs have several different sites of action and thus produce several
  different effects. This means that some of the effects of a drug may
  show tolerance but others may not. For example, barbiturates cause
  sedation and also depress neurons that control respiration. The sedative
  effects show tolerance, but the respiratory depression does not. This
  means that if larger and larger doses of a barbiturate are taken to
  achieve the same level of sedation, the person begins to run the risk of
  taking a dangerously large dose of the drug that may cause respiratory
  failure. Sensitization is the opposite of tolerance: Repeated doses of a
  drug produce greater and greater effects. Sensitization is less common
  than tolerance, and sensitization may develop for some of the effects of
  a drug while tolerance develops for others. For example, repeated
  injections of cocaine become more and more likely to produce movement
  disorders and seizures, whereas the euphoric effects of the drug do not
  show sensitization—and may even show tolerance. (See Figure 4.6.)</p>
<p>Research has demonstrated that some placebo pain effects may operate
  via the opioid system (an endogenous pain-relieving system in the CNS).
  For example, administering a pain-relieving placebo increases activity
  in the opioid system and administering an opioid-blocking drug blocks
  the pain-relieving effects of a placebo (Price et al., 2008).</p>
<p>Before they are released into the synapse, neurotransmitters are
  produced (or, synthesized) by presynaptic neurons. Some psychoactive
  drugs produce their effects by altering the production of
  neurotransmitters. For example, most neurotransmitters are produced from
  molecules called precursors. Some drugs produce their effects by acting
  as precursors to increase the amount of neurotransmitter a cell can
  synthesize and release into the synapse (see step 1 in Figure 4.7).
  Precursor drugs are considered agonists because administering them
  increases activity of the neurotransmitter system. For example, symptoms
  of Parkinson’s disease are due to death of dopamine-releasing cells in
  the substantia nigra. One treatment for this disease involves
  administering l-DOPA. l-DOPA is a precursor for dopamine. The remaining
  cells use the l-DOPA to synthesize additional dopamine, thus replacing
  some of the lost neurotransmission and reducing symptoms of the
  disease</p>
<p>It’s also important to remember that neurotransmitter synthesis is
  controlled by enzymes. Therefore, if a drug deactivates one of these
  enzymes, it will prevent the neurotransmitter from being produced. Such
  a drug serves as an antagonist (see step 2 in Figure 4.7). For example,
  p-chlorophenylalanine (PCPA) inhibits an enzyme necessary for the
  synthesis of serotonin (Dringenberg et al., 1995). PCPA is typically
  used as a research drug in studies to better understand functions of the
  ­serotonin system.</p>
<p>Some drugs act as antagonists by preventing the release of
  neurotransmitters from the terminal button. They do so by deactivating
  the proteins that cause docked synaptic vesicles to fuse with the
  presynaptic membrane and expel their contents into the synaptic cleft
  (see step 5 in Figure 4.7). An example of a drug with this action is
  botulinum toxin (Botox). Botox prevents the release of acetylcholine,
  the neurotransmitter responsible for signaling muscle contractions in
  the PNS. Other drugs have the opposite effect: They act as agonists by
  binding with these proteins and directly triggering release of the
  neurotransmitter</p>
<p>The most important—and most complex—site of action of drugs in the
  nervous system is on receptors, both presynaptic and postsynaptic. Let’s
  consider postsynaptic receptors first. (Here is where the careful
  reading should begin.) Once a neurotransmitter is released, it must
  stimulate the postsynaptic receptors. Some drugs bind with these
  receptors, just as the neurotransmitter does. Once a drug has bound with
  the receptor, it can serve as either an agonist or an antagonist (see
  steps 6 and 7 in Figure 4.7).</p>
<p>Some drug molecules, such as cocaine, attach to the terminal membrane
  transporter molecules responsible for reuptake and inactivate them, thus
  blocking reuptake. Other drug molecules can bind with enzymes that
  normally destroy the neurotransmitter and prevent the enzymes from
  working. Because both types of drugs prolong the presence of molecules
  of the neurotransmitter in the synaptic cleft (and hence in a location
  where these molecules can stimulate postsynaptic receptors), they serve
  as agonists (see steps 10 and 11 in Figure 4.7).</p>
<p>A drug that mimics the effects of a neurotransmitter acts as a
  <strong>direct agonist</strong>. Molecules of the drug attach to the
  binding site to which the neurotransmitter normally attaches. This
  binding causes the receptor to respond in the same way as when the
  neurotransmitter is present. For example, nicotine binds to the
  nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, mimicking the effects of the
  acetylcholine and contributing to the stimulant effects of the drug.
  Drugs that bind with postsynaptic receptors can also serve as
  antagonists.</p>
<p>Molecules of such drugs bind with the receptors but block them from
  being activated. Because they occupy the receptor’s binding site, they
  prevent the neurotransmitter from activating the receptor. These drugs
  are called receptor blockers or <strong>direct antagonists</strong>.
  These types of drugs can have therapeutic effects, such as the dopamine
  antagonist chlorpromazine, which reduces some of the symptoms of
  schizophrenia. Some receptors have multiple binding sites, to which
  different ligands can attach. Molecules of the neurotransmitter bind
  with one site, and other substances (such as neuromodulators and various
  drugs) bind with the others.</p>
<p>Binding of a molecule with one of these alternative sites is referred
  to as noncompetitive binding, because the molecule does not compete with
  molecules of the neurotransmitter for the same binding site. If a drug
  attaches to one of these alternative sites and prevents the ion channel
  from opening, the drug is said to be an indirect antagonist. (See Figure
  4.8.) Two examples of drugs that work in this way are PCP and ketamine.
  These drugs bind to noncompetitive sites as antagonists of the NMDA
  glutamate receptor. The ultimate effect of an indirect antagonist is
  similar to that of a direct antagonist, but its site of action is
  different. If a drug attaches to one of the alternative sites and
  facilitates the opening of the ion channel, it is said to be an indirect
  agonist. Diazepam (Valium) is used to treat the symptoms of anxiety.
  Diazepam is an indirect agonist and requires concurrent binding of GABA
  to produce its antianxiety effects.</p>

<p>There are many different kinds of neurotransmitters— several dozen at
  least (see Table 4.1 for a selection of neurotransmitters and their
  nervous system functions). In the brain, most synaptic communication is
  accomplished by two amino acid neurotransmitters: one with excitatory
  effects (glutamate) and one with inhibitory effects (gammaaminobutyric
  acid, or GABA). A secondary inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitter,
  glycine, is found in the spinal cord and lower brain stem. Most of the
  activity of local circuits of neurons involves balances between the
  excitatory and inhibitory effects of these chemicals, which are
  responsible for most of the information transmitted from place to place
  within the brain. In fact, there are probably no neurons in the brain
  that do not receive excitatory input from glutamate-secreting terminal
  buttons and inhibitory input from neurons that secrete either GABA or
  glycine. With the exception of neurons that detect painful stimuli,
  which secrete a different peptide, all sensory organs transmit
  information to the brain through axons whose terminals release
  glutamate.</p>
<h3>Neurotransmitter
  Production, Storage, and Release</h3>
<p>As you read in the introduction to this section, glutamate is the
  main excitatory neurotransmitter in the brain and spinal cord. Glutamate
  is synthesized from a precursor (glutamine) by an enzyme (glutaminase)
  in one step. After being synthesized, glutamate is stored in vesicles.
  Vesicle glutamate transporters package glutamate into vesicles.
  Glutamate is released from the presynaptic neuron following an action
  potential.</p>
<h3>Receptors</h3>
<p>Investigators have discovered four major types of glutamate
  receptors. Three of these receptors are ionotropic: the NMDA receptor,
  the AMPA receptor, and the kainate receptor. The other glutamate
  receptor—the metabotropic glutamate receptor—is (obviously!)
  metabotropic. Among other functions, some metabotropic glutamate
  receptors serve as presynaptic autoreceptors. Most drugs that affect
  glutamate transmission do so by interacting with the glutamate
  receptors. Chemicals called NMDA, AMPA, and kainate serve as direct
  agonists at the receptors named after them. In addition, one of the most
  common drugs—alcohol—serves as an antagonist of NMDA receptors.</p>
<p>As we will see in Chapter 18, this effect is responsible for the
  seizures that can be provoked by sudden withdrawal from heavy long-term
  alcohol intake. Focusing for a moment on the ionotropic glutamate
  ­receptors, the AMPA receptor is the most common glutamate receptor. It
  controls a sodium channel, so when ­glutamate attaches to the binding
  site, it produces EPSPs. The kainate receptor has similar effects. The
  NMDA receptor has some special—and very important—characteristics. It
  contains at least six different binding sites: four located on the
  exterior of the receptor and two located deep within the ion channel.
  When it is open, the ion channel controlled by the NMDA receptor permits
  both sodium and calcium ions to enter the cell. The influx of both of
  these ions causes a depolarization, of course, but the entry of calcium
  (Ca2+) is especially important.</p>
<p>Calcium serves as a second messenger, binding with—and
  activating—various enzymes within the cell. These enzymes have profound
  effects on the biochemical and structural properties of the cell. As we
  shall see, one important result is alteration in the characteristics of
  the synapse that provide one of the building blocks of a newly formed
  memory. These effects of NMDA receptors will be discussed in much more
  detail in Chapter 13, where you will read about their role in memory
  formation.</p>
<p>What do all the other neurotransmitters do? In general, they have
  modulating effects rather than informationtransmitting effects. That is,
  the release of neurotransmitters other than glutamate, GABA, and glycine
  tends to activate or inhibit entire circuits of neurons that are
  involved in particular brain functions related to behavior and mental
  processes. Because particular drugs can selectively affect neurons that
  secrete particular neurotransmitters, they can have specific effects on
  behavior.</p>
<p>Some neurons secrete simple amino acids as neurotransmitters. Because
  amino acids are used for protein synthesis by all cells of the brain, it
  is a challenge to prove that a particular amino acid is a
  neurotransmitter. However, investigators suspect that at least eight
  amino acids may serve as neurotransmitters in the mammalian CNS. Two
  specific amino acids are especially important because they are the most
  common neurotransmitters in the CNS: glutamate and GABA.</p>

<h3>Glutamate</h3>
<p>Glutamate is removed from the synapse by excitatory amino acid
  transporters and broken down into its building block precursor
  (glutamine) by the enzyme glutamine synthase. A failure to remove
  glutamate from the synapse can have negative consequences. Too much
  glutamate stimulation in the synapse can produce glutamate
  excitotoxicity and damage neurons by prolonged over excitation. As you
  will read in Chapter 15, glutamate excitotoxicity is believed to be
  involved in damage to the brain in stroke and amyotrophic lateral
  sclerosis (ALS; Lou Gehrig’s disease).</p>
<h3>GABA</h3>
<p>GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid) is an inhibitory neurotransmitter, and
  it appears to have a widespread distribution throughout the brain and
  spinal cord. GABA is produced from a precursor (glutamic acid) by the
  action of an enzyme (glutamic acid decarboxylase, or GAD). The drug
  allylglycine inactivates GAD and thus prevents the synthesis of GABA
  (step 2 of Figure 4.7). Allylglycine is typically used as a research
  drug to understand the GABA system. It has little therapeutic use
  because the reduction in GABA contributes to the likelihood of seizures.
  GABA is packaged into vesicles by the vesicle GABA transporter, where it
  is stored until being released following an action potential.</p>
<p>As you know,
  <mark class="highlight1">neurons in the
    brain are greatly interconnected. Without the activity of inhibitory
    synapses these interconnections would make the brain unstable.
  </mark>
  That is, through excitatory synapses neurons would excite their
  neighbors, which would then excite their neighbors, which would then
  excite the originally active neurons, and so on, until most of the
  neurons in the brain would be firing uncontrollably. In fact, this event
  does sometimes occur, and we refer to it as a seizure. Normally, an
  inhibitory influence is supplied by GABA-secreting neurons, which are
  present in large numbers in the brain. Some investigators believe that
  one of the causes of seizure disorders is an abnormality in the
  biochemistry of GABA-secreting neurons or in GABA receptors. ####
  Reuptake and Destruction
</p>
<p>GABA is removed from the synapse by GABA transporters. Tiagabine
  (Gabitril) is a GABA transporter antagonist used to increase
  availability of GABA and reduce the likelihood of seizures. GABA is
  broken down by the enzyme, GABA aminotransferase. Vigabatrin (Sabril)
  blocks the activity of GABA aminotransferase to increase the amount of
  GABA available in the synapse. ­Vigabatrin is also used as a therapeutic
  treatment for seizures and epilepsy. For a summary of some important
  drugs that act on the glutamate and GABA systems, see Table 4.2.</p>
<p>Benzodiazepines and barbiturates promote the activity of the GABAA
  receptor; thus, these drugs serve as indirect agonists. Benzodiazepines
  are very effective anxiolytics, or “anxiety-dissolving” drugs. They are
  used to treat the symptoms of anxiety disorders. Barbiturates are older
  drugs that have similar effects, however they are not considered a
  first-line therapeutic treatment option due to their potentially
  dangerous sedative effects. Drugs that are related to the
  benzodiazepines, such as zolpidem (Ambien) and eszopiclone (Lunesta),
  are effective sleep medications. Picrotoxin has effects opposite to
  those of benzodiazepines and barbiturates: It inhibits the activity of
  the GABAA receptor, thus serving as an indirect antagonist. In high
  enough doses, this drug causes seizures.</p>

</figure>
<p>The acetylcholinergic neurons located in the dorsolateral pons play a
  role in REM sleep (the phase of sleep during which dreaming occurs).
  Those located in the basal forebrain are involved in activating the
  cerebral cortex and facilitating learning, especially perceptual
  learning. Those located in the medial septum control the electrical
  rhythms of the hippocampus and modulate its functions, which include the
  formation of particular kinds of memories. (See Figure 4.11.) ACh is
  unique as an important neurotransmitter because of its functions in both
  the central and peripheral nervous systems. It is the primary
  neurotransmitter secreted by axons of the PNS that terminate at muscle
  cells to control muscle contraction. Because ACh is found outside the
  CNS in locations that are easy to study, this neurotransmitter was the
  first to be discovered.</p>
<p>Just as two different drugs stimulate the two classes of ACh
  receptors, two different drugs block them. The first drug, atropine,
  blocks muscarinic receptors. One of the effects of atropine
  administration is to reduce saliva production. This drug is sometimes
  used in surgery to reduce saliva that could obstruct a patient’s airway
  while unconscious. Another drug, curare, blocks nicotinic receptors.
  Because these receptors are the ones found on muscles, curare, like
  botulinum toxin, causes paralysis. However, the effects of curare are
  much faster.</p>
<h4>Reuptake and Destruction</h4>
<p>You will recall from Chapter 2 that after being released by the
  terminal button, ACh is deactivated by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase
  (AChE), which is present in the postsynaptic membrane. (See Figure
  4.13.) AChE breaks down one molecule of ACh into its two precursors.
  Drugs that deactivate AChE are used for several purposes. AChE
  inhibitors are used to treat symptoms of a hereditary disorder called
  myasthenia gravis. Myasthenia gravis is caused by a person’s immune
  system attacking ACh receptors located on skeletal muscles. The person
  becomes weaker and weaker as the muscles ­become less responsive to the
  neurotransmitter. If the person is given an AChE inhibitor such as
  neostigmine, the person will regain some strength because the ACh that
  is released has a more prolonged effect on the remaining receptors ####
  Neurotransmitter Production, Storage, and Release</p>
<p>Acetylcholine is composed of two precursors: choline and acetyl
  coenzyme A. The enzyme choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), is required to
  produce ACh from the precursors. (See Figure 4.12.) To date, there has
  not been significant development of drugs that can interact with ChAT to
  increase or decrease ACh production</p>
<p>ACh is loaded into vesicles by the vesicle ACh transporter, where it
  is stored until being released from the presynaptic cell. Two drugs,
  botulinum toxin and the venom of the black widow spider, affect the
  release of ACh. Botulinum toxin (Botox) is produced by Clostridium
  botulinum, a bacterium that can grow in improperly canned food. This
  drug prevents the release of ACh. Botulinum toxin is an extremely potent
  poison because the paralysis it can cause leads to suffocation. When
  used locally as an injection into a muscle (rather than being ingested
  and distributed to the entire body), botulinum toxin can have desired
  effects. ­Botox treatments involve injections of very dilute solution of
  botulinum toxin into facial muscles to stop muscular contractions that
  are causing wrinkles in the skin</p>
<h3>Dopamine</h3>
<p>The first catecholamine in Table 4.4, dopamine (DA), produces both
  excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials, depending on the
  postsynaptic receptor. Dopamine has been implicated in several important
  functions, including movement, attention, learning, and the reinforcing
  effects of drugs that people tend to abuse</p>
<p>The three most important dopamine pathways originate in midbrain
  structures: the substantia nigra and ventral tegmental area. The cell
  bodies of neurons of the nigrostriatal system are located in the
  substantia nigra and project their axons to the neostriatum: the caudate
  nucleus and the putamen. The neostriatum is an important part of the
  basal ganglia, which is involved in the control of movement. The cell
  bodies of neurons of the mesolimbic system are located in the ventral
  tegmental area and project their axons to several parts of the limbic
  system, including the nucleus accumbens, amygdala, and hippocampus.</p>
<p>The nucleus accumbens plays an important role in the reinforcing
  (rewarding) effects of certain categories of stimuli, including those of
  drugs that people abuse. The cell bodies of neurons of the mesocortical
  system are also located in the ventral tegmental area. Their axons
  project to the prefrontal cortex. These neurons have an excitatory
  effect on the frontal cortex and affect such functions as formation of
  short-term memories, planning, and strategy preparation for problem
  solving. (See Figure 4.14.) Degeneration of dopaminergic neurons that
  connect the substantia nigra with the caudate nucleus causes Parkinson’s
  disease, a movement disorder characterized by tremors, rigidity of the
  limbs, poor balance, and difficulty in initiating movements.</p>

<p>The monoamine neurotransmitters are produced by several systems of
  neurons in the brain. Most of these systems consist of a relatively
  small number of cell bodies located in the brain stem, whose axons
  branch repeatedly and give rise to an enormous number of terminal
  buttons distributed throughout many regions of the brain. Monoaminergic
  neurons thus serve to modulate the function of widespread regions of the
  brain, increasing or decreasing the activities of particular brain
  functions. Monoamines are considered “classical” neurotransmitters.
  Classical neurotransmitters are a family of relatively small molecules
  that includes the monoamines and ACh. Compared to the classical
  neurotransmitters, peptide neurotransmitters are larger molecules that
  undergo a different type of synthesis. You’ll read more about the
  peptide neurotransmitters in the next section. Dopamine, norepinephrine,
  epinephrine, serotonin, and histamine are five chemicals that belong to
  the family of monoamines. Because the molecular structures of these
  neurotransmitters are similar, some drugs affect the activity of all of
  the systems to some degree. The first three neurotransmitters—dopamine,
  norepinephrine, and epinephrine—belong to a subclass of monoamines
  called catecholamines. It is worthwhile learning the terms in Table 4.4,
  because they will be used throughout the rest of this book.</p>
<p>Catecholamine synthesis is somewhat complicated, but each step is a
  simple one. The precursor molecule is modified slightly, step by step,
  until it achieves its final shape. Each step is controlled by a
  different enzyme, which causes a small part to be added or taken off.
  The precursor for the two major catecholamine neurotransmitters
  (dopamine and norepinephrine) is tyrosine, an essential amino acid that
  we must obtain from our diet. Tyrosine is modified by the enzyme
  tyrosine hydroxylase and becomes l-DOPA (L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine).
  l-DOPA is then modified through the activity of the enzyme DOPA
  decarboxylase and becomes dopamine. Finally, the ­enzyme dopamine
  β-hydroxylase converts dopamine to norepinephrine. Only neurons that
  release norepinephrine contain dopamine β-hydroxylase; however, both
  dopamine- and norepinephrine-releasing neurons contain tyrosine
  hydroxylase</p>
<p>The destruction of catecholamines is regulated by an enzyme called
  monoamine oxidase (MAO). This enzyme is found within monoaminergic
  terminal buttons, where it destroys excess neurotransmitter. A drug
  called deprenyl inhibits the particular form of monoamine oxidase
  (MAO-B) that is found in dopaminergic terminal buttons. Because deprenyl
  prevents the destruction of dopamine, more ­dopamine is available in the
  terminal buttons. Thus, deprenyl serves as a dopamine agonist and can be
  used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease</p>
<p>Almost every region of the brain receives input from noradrenergic
  neurons. The cell bodies of most of these neurons are located in seven
  regions of the pons and medulla and one region of the thalamus. The cell
  bodies of the most important noradrenergic system begin in the locus
  coeruleus, a nucleus located in the dorsal pons. The axons of these
  neurons project to the regions shown in Figure 4.18. As we will see
  later, the primary effect of activation of these neurons is an increase
  in vigilance—attentiveness to events in the environment.</p>
<h3>Norepinephrine</h3>
<h4>Reuptake and Destruction</h4>
<p>The norepinephrine transporter is responsible for removing excess
  norepinephrine from the synapse. Monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) deactivates
  norepinephrine. The drug moclobemide specifically blocks MAO-A and hence
  serves as a noradrenergic agonist. Moclobemide and other MAO inhibitors
  are sometimes used to treat symptoms of depression, however they can
  contribute to problematic side effects. Newer monoamineenhancing drugs,
  such as selective serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine reuptake
  inhibitors block transporters and have largely replaced MAO inhibitors
  in the treatment of depression.</p>
<p>However, for norepinephrine the final step of synthesis occurs inside
  the vesicles themselves. The vesicles are first filled with dopamine.
  Then the dopamine is converted to norepinephrine through the action of
  the enzyme dopamine β-hydroxylase located within the vesicles. The drug
  fusaric acid inhibits the activity of dopamine β-hydroxylase and thus
  blocks the production of norepinephrine without affecting the production
  of dopamine. Fusaric acid is sometimes used by researchers who want to
  investigate the norepinephrine system while leaving the dopamine system
  unaffected</p>
<h3>Serotonin</h3>
<p>Serotonin plays a role in the regulation of mood; in the control of
  eating, sleep, and arousal; and in the regulation of pain. Serotonergic
  neurons are also involved in the control of dreaming</p>
<h3>Histamine</h3>
<h4>Pathways</h4>
<p>The cell bodies of histaminergic neurons are found in only one place
  in the brain: the tuberomammillary nucleus, located in the posterior
  hypothalamus. (See Figure 4.21.) Histaminergic neurons send their axons
  to widespread regions of the cerebral cortex and brain stem. Histamine
  plays an important role in wakefulness. In fact, the activity of
  histaminergic neurons is strongly correlated with the states of sleep
  and wakefulness, and drugs that block histamine receptors (also called
  antihistamines) cause drowsiness. You may have experienced this effect
  if you have ever taken an over-the-counter sleep medication containing
  the common antihistamine diphenhydramine to treat symptoms of allergies
  or insomnia.</p>
<h4>Reuptake and Destruction</h4>
<p>The serotonin transporter is responsible for removing 5-HT from the
  synapse. Drugs that inhibit the reuptake of serotonin have found a very
  important place in the treatment of mental illness. These drugs increase
  the amount of serotonin available at the synapse to bind to 5-HT
  receptors. Interestingly, serotonin reuptake inhibitors must be
  administered for several consecutive weeks in order to achieve a
  therapeutic effect. Researchers believe that important neural
  adaptations occur during this time period to affect the activity of the
  5-HT system. The best known of these drugs, fluoxetine (Prozac), is used
  to treat depression, some forms of anxiety disorders, and
  obsessive-compulsive disorder</p>

<p>In addition to amino acids and classical neurotransmitters, neurons
  of the CNS release a large variety of peptides. In contrast to the
  classical neurotransmitters, peptides consist of two or more amino acids
  linked together by peptide bonds. Neurotransmitter Production,</p>
<h4>Storage, and Release</h4>
<p>All the peptides that have been studied so far are produced from
  precursor molecules. These precursors are large polypeptides that are
  broken into smaller neurotransmitter molecules by special enzymes.
  Neurons manufacture both the polypeptides and the enzymes needed to
  break them apart in the right places. The appropriate sections of the
  polypeptides are retained, and the rest are destroyed. Because the
  synthesis of peptides takes place in the soma, vesicles containing these
  chemicals must be delivered to the terminal buttons by axoplasmic
  transport.</p>
<p>Several different peptides are released by neurons. Although most
  peptides appear to serve as neuromodulators, some act as
  neurotransmitters. One of the best known families of peptides are the
  endogenous opioids. Research has revealed that opiates (drugs such as
  opium, morphine, heroin, and oxycodone) reduce pain because they have
  direct effects on the brain.</p>
<p>CB1 receptors are found on terminal buttons of glutamatergic,
  GABAergic, acetylcholinergic, noradrenergic, dopaminergic, and
  serotonergic neurons, where they serve as presynaptic heteroreceptors,
  regulating neurotransmitter release (Iversen, 2003). When activated, the
  receptors open potassium channels in the terminal buttons, shortening
  the duration of action potentials there and decreasing the amount of
  neurotransmitter that is released. When neurons release cannabinoids,
  the chemicals diffuse a distance of approximately 20 μm in all
  directions, and their effects persist for several tens of seconds. The
  short-term memory impairment that accompanies marijuana use ­appears to
  be caused by the action of THC on CB1 receptors in the hippocampus.
  Endocannabinoids also appear to play an essential role in the
  reinforcing effects of opiates: A targeted mutation that prevents the
  production of CB1 receptors abolishes the reinforcing effects of
  morphine but not of cocaine, amphetamine, or nicotine (Cossu et al.,
  2001). These effects of cannabinoids are discussed further in Chapter
  18.</p>
<p>Agarwal et al. (2007) found that THC exerts its analgesic effects by
  stimulating CB1 receptors in the PNS. In addition, a commonly used
  over-the-counter analgesic, acetaminophen (known as paracetamol in many
  countries), also acts on these receptors. Once it enters the blood,
  acetaminophen is converted into another compound that then joins with
  arachidonic acid, the precursor of anandamide. This compound binds with
  peripheral CB1 receptors and activates them, reducing pain sensation.
  Because the compound does not cross the blood–brain barrier, it does not
  produce effects like those of THC. Administration of a CB1 antagonist
  completely blocks the analgesic effect of acetaminophen (Bertolini et
  al., 2006).</p>
<p>Several different neural systems are activated when opiate receptors
  are stimulated. One type produces analgesia, another inhibits
  species-typical defensive responses such as fleeing and hiding, and
  another stimulates a system of neurons involved in reinforcement
  (“reward”). The last effect explains why opiates are often abused. The
  situations that cause neurons to secrete endogenous opioids are
  discussed in Chapter 7, and the brain mechanisms of opiate addiction are
  discussed in Chapter 18. So far, pharmacologists have developed only two
  types of drugs that affect neural communication by means of opioids:
  direct agonists and antagonists. Many synthetic opiates, including
  heroin, methadone, and oxycodone, have been developed, and some are used
  clinically as analgesics. Several opiate receptor antagonists have also
  been developed. One of them, naloxone (Narcan), is used clinically to
  reverse opiate intoxication or overdose. This drug has saved the lives
  of many people who would otherwise have died from an opiate
  overdose.</p>
<p>Various substances derived from lipids can serve to transmit messages
  within or between cells. The best known, and probably the most
  important, are the endocannabinoids— natural ligands for the receptors
  that are responsible for the physiological effects of the active
  ingredient in marijuana. Matsuda et al. (1990) discovered that THC
  (tetrahydrocannabinol, the active ingredient of marijuana) stimulates
  cannabinoid receptors located in specific regions of the brain. THC
  produces analgesia and sedation, stimulates appetite, reduces nausea
  caused by drugs used to treat cancer, relieves asthma attacks, decreases
  pressure within the eyes in patients with glaucoma, and reduces the
  symptoms of certain motor disorders. On the other hand, THC interferes
  with concentration and memory, alters visual and auditory perception,
  and distorts perceptions of the passage of time. THC can occur naturally
  (produced by the marijuana plant) or it can be manufactured
  synthetically (in drugs such as “Spice” or “K2” as a street drug, or
  dronabinol as a prescription drug).</p>
<h1>Methos and strategies of
  investigacion</h1>
<p>Stereotaxic apparatuses are also made for humans, by the way.
  Sometimes a neurosurgeon produces subcortical lesions—for example, to
  reduce the symptoms of Parkinson’s disease, a treatment you’ll encounter
  in Chapter 15. Usually, the surgeon uses multiple landmarks and verifies
  the location of the wire (or other device) inserted into the brain by
  taking brain scans or recording the activity of the neurons in that
  region before producing a brain lesion. Deep brain stimulation is
  another procedure that requires the use of a stereotaxic apparatus. Deep
  brain stimulation is used to treat chronic pain, movement disorders
  (including Parkinson’s disease), epilepsy, depression, and
  obsessive-compulsive disorder. Deep brain stimulation utilizes a
  stereotaxic apparatus to implant a permanent electrode into the brain of
  patients. Rather than produce a lesion, electrical current passed
  through the electrode is used to stimulate brain regions and reduce
  symptoms (Holtzheimer and Mayberg, 2011a; Sarem-Aslani and Mullett,
  2011).</p>

<p>Light travels at a constant speed of approximately 300,000 kilometers
  (186,000 miles) per second. Thus, if the frequency of oscillation of the
  wave varies, the distance between the peaks of the waves will vary
  similarly but in inverse fashion. Slower oscillations lead to longer
  wavelengths, and faster ones lead to shorter wavelengths.</p>

  <li>Wavelength determines the first of the three perceptual dimensions
    of light: hue.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>visible spectrum</strong> displays the range of hues
    that our eyes can detect. Light can also vary in intensity, which
    corresponds to the second perceptual dimension of light: brightness. If
    the intensity of the electromagnetic radiation is increased, the
    apparent brightness increases, too.
  </li>
  <li>The third dimension, saturation, refers to the relative purity of
    the light that is being perceived. If all the radiation is of one
    wavelength, the perceived color is pure, or fully saturated. Conversely,
    if the radiation contains all visible wavelengths, it produces no
    sensation of hue—it appears white. Colors with intermediate amounts of
    saturation consist of different mixtures of wavelengths.

<p><strong>Transduction</strong> is the name of the process by which
  energy from the environment (for example, light) is converted to a
  change in membrane potential in a neuron. It is a process that converts
  an external stimulus (such as light, sound, or heat) to an internal
  stimulus (the action potential generated by light-, sound-, or
  heat-detecting neurons). Remember that changes in membrane potential can
  be excitatory (­depolarizing) or inhibitory (hyperpolarizing).</p>
<p>Photo­pigments are responsible for transduction of light energy into

              Vergence movements are cooperative movements that keep both eyes fixed on the same target—or, more
              precisely, that keep the image of the target object on corresponding parts of the two retinas. If you hold
              up a finger in front of your face, look at it, and then bring your finger closer to your face, your eyes
              will make vergence movements toward your nose.

<p>A fascinating study with young children demonstrates the importance
  of communication between the dorsal and ventral streams of the visual
  system in perception of form (DeLoache et al., 2004). The experimenters
  let children play with large toys: an indoor slide that they could climb
  and slide down, a chair that they could sit on, and a toy car that they
  could enter. After the children played in and on the large toys, the
  children were taken out of the room, the large toys were replaced with
  identical miniature versions, and the children were then brought back
  into the room. When the children played with the miniature toys, they
  acted as if they were the large versions: They tried to climb onto the
  slide, climb into the car, and sit on the chair. One child said “In!”
  several times and turning to his mother, apparently asked her to help
  him.
  <mark class="highlight1">The authors suggest that this
    child’s behavior reflects incomplete maturation of connections between
    the dorsal and ventral streams. The ventral stream recognizes the
    identity of the objects, and the dorsal stream recognizes their size,
    but in the developing brain the information is not adequately shared
    between these two systems
  </mark>
</p>
<p>With the advent of functional imaging, investigators have studied the
  responses of the typical human brain and have discovered several regions
  of the ventral stream that are activated by the sight of particular
  categories of visual stimuli. For example,
  <mark class="highlight2">researchers have identified regions
    of the inferior temporal and lateral occipital cortex that are
    specifically activated by categories such as animals, tools, cars,
    flowers, letters and letter strings, faces, bodies, and scenes.
  </mark>
  (See Grill-Spector and Malach, 2004, and Tootell et al., 2003 for a
  review.)
</p>
<p>However, not all of these findings have been replicated, and
  general-purpose regions contain circuits that can learn to recognize
  shapes that do not fall into these categories. A relatively large region
  of the ventral stream of the visual association cortex, the lateral
  occipital complex (LOC), appears to respond to a wide variety of objects
  and shapes. A functional-imaging study by Downing et al., (2006)
  suggests that there are few regions of the extrastriate cortex devoted
  to the analysis of specific categories of stimuli. The investigators
  presented images of objects from 19 different categories to a control
  group and found only three regions that showed the greatest activation
  to the sight of specific categories: faces, bodies, and scenes. Bell et
  al., (2009) found that in both the human and the monkey brain, regions
  that responded to faces and body parts were adjacent to each other, as
  were those that responded to objects and scenes of places. (See Figure
  6.27.)</p>
<p>A functional-imaging study (Golby et al., 2001) found higher
  activation of the fusiform face area when people viewed pictures of
  faces of members of their own race (African Americans or European
  Americans). Participants in this study recognized faces of people of
  their own race more accurately than faces of people of another race.
  Presumably, this difference reflected the fact that the people in the
  study had more experience seeing members of their own race, which
  indicates that expertise does appear to play a role in face
  recognition.</p>

<p>As we will see in Chapter 17,
  <mark class="highlight1">people with autism spectrum
    disorder have difficulty developing typical social relations with other
    people. Grelotti et al., (2002) found that people with this disorder
    showed a deficit in the ability to recognize faces and that looking at
    faces failed to activate the fusiform gyrus. (See Figure 6.33.) The
    authors speculate that the lack of interest in other people, caused by
    the brain abnormalities responsible for autism spectrum disorder,
    resulted in a lack of motivation that normally promotes the acquisition
    of expertise in recognizing faces as a child grows up.
  </mark>
  Chapter 17
  discusses autism spectrum disorder in more detail.
</p>
<p>Most neurons in the striate cortex are sensitive to orientation. That
  is, if a line or an edge (the border of a light and a dark region) is
  positioned in the cell’s receptive field and rotated around its center,
  the cell will respond only when the line is in a particular position—a
  particular orientation. Some neurons respond best to a vertical line,
  some to a horizontal line, and some to a line oriented somewhere in
  between. Figure 6.35 shows the responses of a neuron in the striate
  cortex when lines were presented at various orientations. As you can
  see, this neuron responded best when a vertical line was presented in
  its receptive field.</p>
<p>Accurately determining the velocity and direction of movement of an
  object is an important ability. That moving object could be a prey
  animal trying to run away, a predator trying to catch you, or a
  projectile you are trying to catch (or keep from hitting you). If we are
  to accurately track moving objects, the information received by V5 must
  be up to date. In fact, the axons that transmit information from the
  magnocellular system are thick and heavily myelinated, which increases
  the rate at which they conduct action potentials. Petersen et al. (1988)
  recorded the responses of neurons in areas V4 and V5 and found that
  visual information reached the V5 neurons sooner than it reached those
  in area V4, whose neurons are involved in the analysis of form and
  color.</p>

  <img alt="Titulo" src="../../img/notes/content/physiologyofbehavior-spatialfiltering.jpg">

    The two pictures contain the same amount of low-frequency information,
    but extraneous high-frequency information has been filtered from the
    picture on the right. If you look at the pictures from across the room,
    they look identical.
  </footer>
</figure>
<p>The filtration process removes this noise—and makes the image much
  clearer to the human visual system. Presumably, the high frequencies
  produced by the edges of the squares in the left figure stimulate
  neurons in the striate cortex that are tuned to high spatial
  frequencies. When the visual association cortex receives this noisy
  information, it has difficulty perceiving the underlying form.</p>
<p>If you want to watch the effect of filtering the extraneous
  high-frequency noise, try the following demonstration. Look at the
  pictures in Figure 6.26 from across the room. The distance “erases” the
  high frequencies, because they exceed the resolving power of the eye,
  and the two pictures look identical. Now walk toward the pictures,
  focusing on the left figure. As you get closer, the higher frequencies
  reappear, and this picture looks less and less like the face of
  Lincoln.</p>
<p>A study by Le Grand et al., (2001) discovered that
  <mark class="highlight1">the experience of seeing faces very
    early in life plays a critical role in the development of the skills
    necessary for recognizing them later in life.
  </mark>
  The investigators
  tested the ability of people (aged 9–21 years) who had been born with
  congenital cataracts to recognize subtle differences between pairs of
  faces. These people had been unable to see more than light and dark
  until they received eye surgery at 62–187 days of age that made normal
  vision possible. The early visual deprivation resulted in a severe
  deficit, compared with the performance of control participants, in
  recognizing the facial differences.
