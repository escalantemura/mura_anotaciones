<h1>The
government is overfunctioning and misfunctioning</h1>
<p>None of this means that government does not have a very real
function. Indeed, the tragedy is that because government is doing so
many things it ought not to be doing, it performs the functions it ought
to be performing badly. The basic functions of government are</p>
<ol>
<li>to defend the nation against foreign enemies,</li>
<li>to prevent coercion of some individuals by others within the
country,</li>
<li>to provide a means of deciding on our rules, and to adjudicate
disputes.</li>
</ol>
<h1>The self interest</h1>
<p>One common explanation of why government is the problem, and one that
I have often stressed, is the influence of special interests. Government
actions often provide substantial benefits to a few while imposing small
costs on many</p>
<p>The people who run our private enterprises have the same incentive as
the people who are involved in our government enterprises. In all cases
the incentive is the same: to promote their own interest. My old friend
Armen Alchian, who is a professor at the University of California at Los
Angeles, put the point this way: There is one thing, he said, that you
can trust everybody to do and that is to put his interest above yours.
The people who run our private enterprises are people of the same kind
as those who run our public enterprises, just as the Chinese in Hong
Kong are the same as the Chinese in Mainland China; just as the West
Germans and the East Germans were not different people, yet the results
were vastly different.</p>
<p>The point is that self-interest is served by different actions in the
private sphere than in the public sphere. The bottom line is different.
An enterprise started by a group of people in the private sphere may
succeed or fail. Most new enterprises fail (if the enterprise were
clearly destined for success, it would probably already exist). If the
enterprise fails, it loses money. The people who own it have a clear
bottom line. To keep it going, they have to dig into their own pockets.
They are reluctant to do that, so they have a strong incentive either to
make the enterprise work or to shut it down.</p>
<p>Suppose the same group of people start the same enterprise in the
government sector and the initial results are the same. It is a failure;
it does not work. They have a very different bottom line. Nobody likes
to admit that he has made a mistake, and they do not have to. They can
argue that the enterprise initially failed only because it was not
pursued on a large enough scale. More important, they have a much
different and deeper pocket to draw on. With the best intentions in the
world, they can try to persuade the people who hold the purse strings to
finance the enterprise on a larger scale, to dig deeper into the pockets
of the taxpayers to keep the enterprise going. That illustrates a
general rule: <mark class="highlight1">If a private
enterprise is a failure, it closes down—unless it can get a government
subsidy to keep it going; if a government enterprise fails, it is
expanded. I challenge you to find exceptions.</mark></p>
<h1>The government is
overspending</h1>
<p>However, the liberal pundits are wrong in a more fundamental way. The
problem is not that government is spending too little but that it is
spending too much. The problem in schooling is that government is
spending too much on the wrong things. The problem in health care is
that government is spending too much on the wrong things. The end result
has been that government has become a self-generating monstrosity.
Abraham Lincoln talked about a government of the people, by the people,
for the people. What we now have is a government of the people, by the
bureaucrats, including the legislators who have become bureaucrats, for
the bureaucrats.</p>
<p>Again, let me emphasize, the problem is not that bureaucrats are bad
people. The problem, as the Marxists would say, is with the system, not
with the people. <mark class="highlight1">The self-interest
of people in government leads them to behave in a way that is against
the self-interest of the rest of us.</mark> You remember Adam Smith’s
famous law of the invisible hand: People who intend only to seek their
own benefit are “led by an invisible hand to serve a public interest
which was no part of” their intention. I say that there is a reverse
invisible hand: People who intend to serve only the public interest are
led by an invisible hand to serve private interests which was no part of
their intention</p>
<p>In the 1930s, it went the other way.
<mark class="highlight1">It is ironic that the Great
Depression was produced by government but was blamed on the private
enterprise system.</mark> The Federal Reserve System explained in its
1933 annual report how much worse things would have been if the Federal
Reserve had not behaved so well, yet the Federal Reserve was the chief
culprit in making the depression as deep as it was.</p>
<p>So the government produced the depression, the private enterprise
system got blamed for it, and there was a tremendous change in
attitudes. When you say ideas are not important, that change in
attitudes would not have been possible if the groundwork had not been
laid by the socialist intellectuals in the 1920s. It is interesting to
note that every economic plank of the 1928 Socialist party platform has
by now been either wholly or partly enacted.</p>
<h1>Competitiveness</h1>
<p>I do not believe in the concept of a competitive advantage in the
global economy. We are not harmed by other people improving their
standard of living relative to ours; we are helped.
<mark class="highlight1">The notion of competitiveness, of
which so much is spoken, makes sense for an individual enterprise but it
does not make any sense for a country.</mark> Poor countries can trade
with rich countries. A country that is inefficient in almost everything
can still trade with one that is very efficient. The economists have a
name for that: what determines things is comparative advantage, not
absolute advantage. Almost all talk about national competitiveness rests
on the fallacy of not considering what determines the exchange rate. It
assumes a given exchange rate and then all sorts of things follow that
in practice do not occur because, if the exchange rate is inappropriate,
it cannot be maintained.</p>
<p>How did the Americans absorb the immigrants in the nineteenth
century? How did they absorb my mother and father, who came to this
country at the ages of fourteen and sixteen, respectively, with nothing
but their hands? I assure you that there was no welfare office they
could go to when they came. There was no governmental relief, but they
were able to make their way because there were no barriers to their
doing so. I talked about taxicabs in New York. One of the most important
programs you could have for the disadvantaged in New York would be to
eliminate the limitations on cab licenses. Look at the city of
Washington, where for a long time there were essentially no limits; the
cabdrivers are far more heterogeneous in Washington, D.C., than they are
in New York.</p>
<h1>The free market system</h1>
<p>The great virtue of a free market system is that it does not care
what color people are; it does not care what their religion is; it only
cares whether they can produce something you want to buy.
<mark class="highlight1">It is the most effective system we
have discovered to enable people who hate one another to deal with one
another and help one another.</mark></p>
