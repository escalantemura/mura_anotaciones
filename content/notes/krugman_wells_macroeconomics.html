<h1>International trade</h1>
<p>Foreign trade isn’t the only way countries interact economically. In
  the modern world, investors from one country often invest funds in
  another nation; many companies are multinational, with subsidiaries
  operating in several countries; and a growing number of people work in a
  country different from the one in which they were born. The growth of
  all these forms of economic linkages among countries is often called
  globalization.</p>
<p>Globalization isn’t a new phenomenon. As you can see from panel (a)
  of Figure 5-1, there was rapid growth in trade between 1870 and the
  beginning of World War I, as railroads and steamships effectively made
  shipping goods long distances faster and cheaper, effectively shrinking
  the world. This growth of trade was accompanied by large-scale
  international investment and migration. However, globalization went into
  reverse for almost 40 years after World War I, as governments imposed
  limits on trade of the kind analyzed later in this chapter. And by
  several measures, globalization didn’t return to 1913 levels until the
  1980s.</p>
<p>Since then, however, there has been a further dramatic increase in
  international linkages, sometimes referred to as hyperglobalization,
  exemplified by the way manufacture of iPhones and other high-tech goods
  involves supply chains of production that span the globe, and in which
  each stage of a good’s production takes place in a different country—all
  made possible by advances in communication and transportation
  technology.</p>
<p>The straight-line shape implies that the opportunity cost of a phone
  in terms of trucks in each country is constant—it does not depend on how
  many units of each good the country produces. The analysis of
  international trade under the assumption that opportunity costs are
  constant, which makes production possibility frontiers straight lines,
  is known as the <strong>Ricardian model of international trade</strong>
  , named after the English economist David Ricardo, who introduced this
  analysis in the early nineteenth century.</p>
<p>Economists use the term <strong>autarky</strong> to refer to a
  situation in which a country does not trade with other countries. We
  assume that in autarky the United States chooses to produce and consume
  50 million phones and 50,000 trucks. We also assume that in autarky
  China produces 100 million phones and 25,000 trucks.</p>
<h2>Sources of Comparative
  Advantage</h2>
<p>International trade is driven by comparative advantage, but where
  does comparative advantage come from? Economists who study international
  trade have found three main sources of comparative advantage:
  international differences in climate, international differences in
  factor endowments, and international differences in technology.</p>
<h3>Differences in Climate</h3>
<p>One key reason the opportunity cost of producing shrimp in Vietnam
  and Thailand is less than in the United States is that shrimp need warm
  water—Vietnam has plenty of that, but America doesn’t. In general,
  differences in climate play a significant role in international trade.
  Tropical countries export tropical products like coffee, sugar, bananas,
  and shrimp. Countries in the temperate zones export crops like wheat and
  corn. Some trade is even driven by the difference in seasons between the
  northern and southern hemispheres: winter deliveries of Chilean grapes
  and New Zealand apples have become commonplace in U.S. and European
  supermarkets.</p>
<h3>Differences in Factor
  Endowments</h3>
<p>Canada has a comparative advantage in forest products because its
  forested area is much greater compared to the size of its labor force
  than the ratio of forestland to the labor force in the United
  States.</p>
<p>Forestland, like labor and capital, is a factor of production: an
  input used to produce goods and services. (Recall from Chapter 2 that
  the factors of production are land, labor, physical capital, and human
  capital.) Due to history and geography, the mix of available factors of
  production differs among countries, providing an important source of
  comparative advantage. The relationship between comparative advantage
  and factor availability is found in an influential model of
  international trade, the Heckscher–Ohlin model, developed by two Swedish
  economists in the first half of the twentieth century.</p>
<p>Two key concepts in the model are factor abundance and factor
  intensity. Factor abundance refers to how large a country’s supply of a
  factor is relative to its supply of other factors. <strong>Factor
    intensity</strong> refers to the ranking of goods according to which
  factor is used in relatively greater quantities in production compared
  to other factors. So oil refining is a capital-intensive good because it
  tends to use a high ratio of capital to labor, but phone production is a
  labor-intensive good because it tends to use a high ratio of labor to
  capital.</p>
<p>According to the <strong>Heckscher–Ohlin model,</strong> <em>a
  country that has an abundant supply of a factor of production will have
  a comparative advantage in goods whose production is intensive in that
  factor</em>. So a country that has a relative abundance of capital will
  have a comparative advantage in capital-intensive industries such as oil
  refining, but a country that has a relative abundance of labor will have
  a comparative advantage in labor-intensive industries such as phone
  production.</p>
<p>The basic intuition behind this result is simple and based on
  opportunity cost.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The opportunity cost of a given factor—the value that the factor
    would generate in alternative uses—is low for a country when it is
    relatively abundant in that factor.
  </li>
  <li>Relative to the United States, China has an abundance of low-skilled
    labor.
  </li>
  <li>As a result, the opportunity cost of the production of low-skilled,
    labor-intensive goods is lower in China than in the United States.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The fact that international trade is the result of differences in
  factor endowments helps explain another fact: international
  specialization of production is often <em>incomplete</em>. That is, a
  country often maintains some domestic production of a good that it
  imports. A good example of this is the United States and oil. Saudi
  Arabia exports oil to the United States because Saudi Arabia has an
  abundant supply of oil relative to its other factors of production; the
  United States exports medical devices to Saudi Arabia because it has an
  abundant supply of expertise in medical technology relative to its other
  factors of production. But the United States also produces some oil
  domestically because the size of its domestic oil reserves in Texas and
  Alaska (and now, increasingly, its oil shale reserves elsewhere) makes
  it economical to do so.</p>
<h3>Differences in Technology</h3>
<p>The causes of differences in technology are somewhat mysterious.
  Sometimes they seem to be based on knowledge accumulated through
  experience—for example, Switzerland’s comparative advantage in watches
  reflects a long tradition of watchmaking. Sometimes they are the result
  of a set of innovations that for some reason occur in one country but
  not in others.</p>
<p>Technological advantage, however, is often transitory. By adopting
  lean production (techniques designed to improve manufacturing
  productivity through increased efficiency), American auto manufacturers
  have closed much of the gap in productivity with their Japanese
  competitors. In addition, Europe’s aircraft industry has closed a
  similar gap with the U.S. aircraft industry. At any given point in time,
  however, differences in technology are a major source of comparative
  advantage.</p>
<h2>Supply, Demand, and
  International Trade</h2>
<h3>Domestic demand and supply
  curve</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Titulo" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmacroeconomics-equilibrium.jpg">
</figure>
<p>The <strong>domestic demand curve</strong> shows how the quantity of
  a good demanded by residents of a country depends on the price of that
  good. Why “domestic”? Because people living in other countries may
  demand the good, too. Once we introduce international trade, we need to
  distinguish between purchases of a good by domestic consumers and
  purchases by foreign consumers. So the domestic demand curve reflects
  only the demand of residents of our own country.</p>
<p>Similarly, the <strong>domestic supply curve</strong> shows how the
  quantity of a good supplied by producers inside our own country depends
  on the price of that good. Once we introduce international trade, we
  need to distinguish between the supply of domestic producers and foreign
  supply—supply brought in from abroad.</p>
<p><strong>In autarky</strong> , with no international trade in phones,
  <mark class="highlight1">the equilibrium in this market
    would be determined by the intersection of the domestic demand and
    domestic supply curves
  </mark>
  , point <em>A</em>. The equilibrium price
  of phones would be _P __A_, and the equilibrium quantity of phones
  produced and consumed would be _Q__ A_. As always, both consumers and
  producers gain from the existence of the domestic market.
</p>
<h3>Market opened with only
  imports</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Titulo" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmacroeconomics-equilibrium2.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Now let’s imagine opening up this market to imports. To do this, we
  must make an assumption about the supply of imports. The simplest
  assumption, which we will adopt here, is that unlimited quantities of
  phones can be purchased from abroad at a fixed price, known as the world
  price of phones. Figure 5-6 shows a situation in which <strong>the world
    price</strong> of a phone, PW, is lower than the price of a phone that
  would prevail in the domestic market in autarky, PA.</p>
<p>Here the world price of phones,
  <em>P <strong>W</strong></em>
  , is below the autarky price,
  <em>P <strong>A</strong></em>
  . When the economy is opened to international trade, imports
  enter the domestic market, and the domestic price falls from the autarky
  price, <em>P <strong>A</strong></em>, to the world price, <em>P <strong>W</strong></em>. As the price falls, the
  domestic quantity demanded rises from <em>Q <strong>A</strong></em> to <em>Q <strong>D</strong></em> and the
  domestic quantity supplied falls from <em>Q <strong>A</strong></em> to <em>Q <strong>S</strong></em>. The difference
  between domestic quantity demanded and domestic quantity supplied at <em>P <strong>W</strong></em>, the quantity <em>Q
    <strong>D</strong></em> - <em>Q <strong>S</strong></em>, is filled by imports.
</p>
<p>Given that the world price is below the domestic price of a phone, it
  is profitable for importers to buy phones abroad and resell them
  domestically. The imported phones increase the supply of phones in the
  domestic market, driving down the domestic market price. Phones will
  continue to be imported until the domestic price falls to a level equal
  to the world price.</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Titulo" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmacroeconomics-equilibrium3.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Now let’s turn to the effects of imports on consumer surplus and
  producer surplus. Because imports of phones lead to a fall in their
  domestic price, consumer surplus rises and producer surplus falls.
  Figure 5-7 shows how this works. We label four areas: <em>W, X, Y</em>,
  and <em>Z</em>. The autarky consumer surplus we identified in Figure 5-5
  corresponds to <em>W</em>, and the autarky producer surplus corresponds
  to the sum of <em>X</em> and <em>Y</em>. The fall in the domestic price
  to the world price leads to an increase in consumer surplus; it
  increases by <em>X</em> and <em>Z</em>, so consumer surplus now equals
  the sum of <em>W, X</em>, and <em>Z</em>. At the same time, producers
  lose <em>X</em> in surplus, so producer surplus now equals only
  <em>Y</em>.</p>
<p>
  <mark class="highlight1">When the domestic price falls to
    <i>P<sub>W</sub></i> as a result of international trade, consumers gain
    additional surplus (areas <i>X</i> + <i>Z</i>) and producers lose
    surplus (area <i>X</i>).
  </mark>
  Because the gains to consumers outweigh
  the losses to producers, there is an increase in the total surplus in
  the economy as a whole (area <i>Z</i>).
</p>
<h3>Market opened with only
  exports</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Titulo" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmacroeconomics-equilibrium4.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Here the world price, <em>P</em><sub>W</sub>, is greater than the
  autarky price, <em>P</em><sub>A</sub>. When the economy is opened to
  international trade, some of the domestic supply is now exported. The
  domestic price rises from the autarky price, <em>P</em><sub>A</sub>, to
  the world price, <em>P<sub>W</sub>. As the price rises, the domestic
    quantity demanded falls from</em> <em>Q</em><sub>A</sub> to
  <em>Q</em><sub>D</sub> and the domestic quantity supplied rises from
  <em>Q</em><sub>A</sub> to <em>Q<sub>S</sub>. The portion of domestic
    production that is not consumed domestically,</em>
  <em>Q</em><sub>S</sub> - _Q<sub>D</sub>, is exported.</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Titulo" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmacroeconomics-equilibrium5.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Like imports, exports lead to an overall gain in total surplus for
  the exporting country but also create losers as well as winners. Figure
  5-9 shows the effects of truck exports on producer and consumer surplus.
  In the absence of trade, the price of each truck would be
  <em>P<sub>A</sub>. Consumer surplus in the absence of trade is the sum
    of areas</em> <em>W</em> and <em>X</em>, and producer surplus is area
  <em>Y</em>.</p>
<p>As a result of trade, price rises from <em>P<sub>A</sub> to</em>
  <em>P</em><sub>W</sub>, consumer surplus falls to <em>W</em>, and
  producer surplus rises to <em>Y</em> + <em>X</em> + <em>Z</em>. So
  producers gain <em>X</em> + <em>Z</em>, consumers lose <em>X</em>, and,
  as shown in the table accompanying the figure, the economy as a whole
  gains total surplus in the amount of <em>Z</em>.</p>
<p>
  <mark class="highlight1">When the domestic price rises to
    <i>P</i><sub>W</sub> as a result of trade, producers gain additional
    surplus (area <i>X</i> + <i>Z</i>) but consumers lose surplus (area
    <i>X</i>).
  </mark>
  Because the gains to producers outweigh the losses to
  consumers, there is an increase in the total surplus in the economy as a
  whole (area <em>Z</em>).
</p>
<h2>Exporting and importing
  industries</h2>
<p>Now think of a country’s industries as consisting of two kinds:
  <strong>exporting industries</strong> , which produce goods and services
  that are sold abroad, and <strong>import-competing industries</strong> ,
  which produce goods and services that are also imported from abroad.
  Compared with autarky, international trade leads to higher production in
  exporting industries and lower production in import-competing
  industries. This indirectly increases the demand for factors used by
  exporting industries and decreases the demand for factors used by
  import-competing industries.</p>
<p>In addition, the Heckscher–Ohlin model says that a country tends to
  export goods that are intensive in its abundant factors and to import
  goods that are intensive in its scarce factors. So international trade
  tends to increase the demand for factors that are abundant in our
  country compared with other countries, and to decrease the demand for
  factors that are scarce in our country compared with other countries. As
  a result, the prices of abundant factors tend to rise, and the prices of
  scarce factors tend to fall as international trade grows.</p>
<h2>The Effects of Trade
  Protection</h2>
<p>Despite the free-trade arguments of economists, however, many
  governments use taxes and other restrictions to limit imports. Less
  frequently, governments offer subsidies to encourage exports. Policies
  that limit imports, usually with the goal of protecting domestic
  producers in import-competing industries from foreign competition, are
  known as <strong>trade protection</strong> or simply as protection.</p>
<h3> The Effects of a Tariff</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Titulo" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmacroeconomics-equilibrium6.jpg">
</figure>
<p>A tariff is a form of excise tax, one that is levied only on sales of
  imported goods. For example, the U.S. government could declare that
  anyone bringing in phones must pay a tariff of $100 per unit. In the
  distant past, tariffs were an important source of government revenue
  because they were relatively easy to collect. But in the modern world,
  tariffs are usually intended to discourage imports and protect
  import-competing domestic producers rather than as a source of
  government revenue.</p>
<p>The welfare effects of a tariff are summarized in the table in Figure
  5-11. Producers gain, consumers lose, and the government gains. But
  consumer losses are greater than the sum of producer and government
  gains, leading to a net reduction in total surplus equal to areas B +
  D.</p>
<h3>The Effects of an Import
  Quota</h3>
<p>An import quota, another form of trade protection, is a legal limit
  on the quantity of a good that can be imported. For example, a U.S.
  import quota on Chinese phones might limit the quantity imported each
  year to 50 million units. Import quotas are usually administered through
  licenses: a number of licenses are issued, each giving the
  license-holder the right to import a limited quantity of the good each
  year.</p>
<p>A quota on sales has the same effect as an excise tax, with one
  difference: the money that would otherwise have accrued to the
  government as tax revenue under an excise tax becomes license-holders’
  revenue under a quota—also known as quota rents. (Quota rent is defined
  in Chapter 4.) Similarly, an import quota has the same effect as a
  tariff, with one difference: the money that would otherwise have been
  government revenue becomes quota rents to license-holders.</p>
<h2>Politics of trade protection</h2>
<p>In reality, much trade protection has little to do with the arguments
  just described. Instead, it reflects the political influence of
  import-competing producers.</p>
<p>We’ve seen that a tariff or import quota leads to gains for
  import-competing producers and losses for consumers. Producers, however,
  usually have much more influence over trade policy decisions. The
  producers who compete with imports of a particular good are usually a
  smaller, more cohesive group than the consumers of that good.</p>
<p>An example is the import quota on sugar. This quota hurts millions of
  consumers, but by and large they don’t even know it exists. Meanwhile,
  it benefits a few thousand growers, who are very aware of these benefits
  and hire lobbyists to keep those benefits coming.</p>
<p>Because countries care about one anothers’ trade policies, they enter
  into <strong>international trade agreements</strong> : treaties in which
  a country promises to engage in less trade protection against the
  exports of another country in return for a promise by the other country
  to do the same for its own exports. Most world trade is now governed by
  such agreements.</p>
<p>Chinese exports to the United States overwhelmingly consist of
  labor-intensive manufactured goods. However, some U.S. workers have
  recently found themselves facing a new form of international
  competition. <strong>Outsourcing</strong> , in which a company hires
  another company to perform some task, such as running the corporate
  computer system, is a long-standing business practice. Until recently,
  however, outsourcing was normally done locally, with a company hiring
  another company in the same city or country.</p>
<p>Now, modern telecommunications increasingly make it possible to
  engage in <strong>offshore outsourcing</strong> , in which businesses
  hire people in another country to perform various tasks. The classic
  example is call centers: the person answering the phone when you call a
  company’s 1-800 help line may well be in India, which has taken the lead
  in attracting offshore outsourcing. Offshore outsourcing has also spread
  to fields such as software design and even health care: the radiologist
  examining your X-rays, like the person giving you computer help, may be
  on another continent.</p>
<h1>Macroeconomics</h1>
<p><strong>Monetary policy</strong> uses changes in the quantity of
  money to alter interest rates, which in turn affect the level of overall
  spending. <strong>Fiscal policy</strong> uses changes in taxes and
  government spending to affect overall spending.</p>
