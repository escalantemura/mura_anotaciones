<h1>Sexual
responsiveness and determinants of orgasm capacity</h1>
<p>One of the primary facts that became clear is that a woman’s sexual
behavior is exceedingly complex. Any one aspect of it is not easily
predictable from other aspects.</p>
<ul>
<li>To know that a woman has a high intercourse rate does not predict
whether her ability to attain orgasm is high.</li>
<li>To know that a woman enjoys masturbation does not predict her
feelings and attitudes during intercourse with her husband.</li>
<li>To know that a woman uses a large repertory of intercourse positions
does not predict her orgasm potential.</li>
</ul>
<p>As discussed in detail later, there are many aspects of a woman’s
sexual behavior that do not seem to be related. They have in common only
the fact that they are labeled as “sexual”.</p>
<p>The nature of the correlation between experiencing orgasm and
enjoying sexual interaction is a complicated one that is not as high as
one might expect.</p>
<p>One of the most common speculations about limited sexual
responsiveness is that it represents a form of psychological
maladjustment. Freud and other psychoanalytic theorists hve been leaders
in equiatin psychological maturity with the ability to become sexually
aroused, and even more specifically to achieve orgasm.</p>
<p>“Females who subsequently become psychiatric patients and who do not
go to college, arrive at sexual maturity with less inhibiting attitudes
to coitus than their nonpsychiatric counterparts”.</p>
<p>Interviewed 175 prostitutes and found that they experienced orgasm
and multiple orgasm more frequently in their personal “noncommercial”
intercourse than did normal women. Over 20 percent of the prostitutes
reported frequently experiencing orgasms while having intercourse with
customers.</p>
<p>Those in therapy were found to engage in intercourse more frequently
and to enjoy it more than those about to begin therapy. Graham
concluded, “The results of this study seem to bear out with certain
reservations the assumption that psychoanalytically oriented
psychotherapy does free the individual for more frequent and more
satisfactory coital experience”.</p>
<p>It would be an overstatement to say that the existing empirical
literature indicates no relationship at all between degree of
maladjustment and sexual responsiveness.</p>
<p>The weight of the empirical evidence favors the view that one can be
seriously maladjusted and even schizophrenic and still enjoy a normal
amount of sexual responsivity. <mark class="highlight1">The
existing data are not persuasive that general psychological
maladjustment, as such, plays a major role in sexual responsiveness. It
may prove to be true that certain types of maladjustment linked with
specific symptom syndromes, such as conversion hysteria, do result in
disturbed sexual responsiveness; but this remains to be seen</mark>.</p>
<h2>Basic factors
defining sexual responsiveness</h2>
<h3>Education</h3>
<p>The association of orgasm capacity with educatioal level is a
puzzling and intriguing one. There is no existing theory about the
nature of sexual responsiveness in women that would explain it.</p>
<h3>Social class</h3>
<p>It was found that whereas 50 percent of the middle-class married
women had a “very positive” attitude toward sex relations, only 20
percent of the “lower-lower” subjects felt such a strongly positive
attitude. Conversely, whereas 20 percent of the “lower-lower” rejected
sex, only 3 percent of the “middle-class” women did so.</p>
<p>Rainwater pointed out that spouse roles in the lower classes were
highly differenciated, with a minimum of mutuality and motivation for
inimate interchange. In the middle classes, husband-wife roles appeared
to be less segregated and differentiated, and there was emphasis upon
close communication between spouses.</p>
<p>It was the factor of greater intimacy and closeness that Rainwater
considered to account for the fact of relatively greater favorableness
toward sex among middle-class women.</p>
<p>Mead (49’): “<mark class="highlight1">The human female’s
capacity for orgasm is to be viewed much more as a potentially that may
or may not be developed by a given culure…</mark>”.</p>
<h3>Religion</h3>
<p>One may say that among married women who, in contrast to the
unmarried, have an equal opportunity for legally and morally approved
sexual intercourse, religion does not generally affect orgasm
consistency. There are suggestions that women who are at the far extreme
of religiosity may display reduced orgasmic response.</p>
<p>Masters and Johnson (1970) assert on the basis of their
impressionistic clinical experience that religiosity that assigns
negative value to sexuality is a significant factor in limiting sexual
responsiveness in women they have interviewed and treated for sexual
problems.</p>
<h3>Age</h3>
<p>Women who, in their youner years, had found intercourse stimulating
and who had the opportunity for regular stimulation, were able to
maintain high leves of responsiveness, even into their sixties and
occasionally into the seventies.</p>
<p>There is no real indication, within a large range, that women lose
their ability to be sexually responsive as they grow older.</p>
<h3>Practice effects</h3>
<p>There is a fair probability that practice effects facilitate sexual
responsiveness to some degree. But the effects seem to be variable and
in some pupulations have not been detectable.</p>
<h3>Traumatic episodes</h3>
<p>No relation.</p>
<p>O’Neil and Kempler (1969) have presented experimental evidence that
conversion hysterics are particularly disturbed by words with sexual
connotations that are presented to them under “sexually seductive”
conditions. They concluded that conversion hysterics show especial
“conflict involving sexual motives and sexual behavior”.</p>
<h3>Motherhood and responsivity</h3>
<p>All the investigators of this problem have unanimously concluded that
a woman’s sexual responsiveness has only a chance relationship with the
number of children she has borne.</p>
<h3>Physical attributes and
responsivity</h3>
<p>Generally, one cannot see a connection between sexual responsiveness
and how early or late pubertal changes began.</p>
<p>Simple measues and ratings of body configuration do not correlate
with sexual responsiveness.</p>
<p>The question whether estrogen, androgen, and other hormonal levels of
women are, within the normal range, predictive of sexual responsiveness
remains open, but the existing evidence is not promising.</p>
<p>Fink (1970) has recommended the revival of Freud’s old idea that an
inability to attain sexual relief may produce psychological disturbance.
That women who do not achieve orgasm in the sexual act develop pelvic
vasocongestion that can produce somatic and psychological distress.</p>
<p>Severe body disablement or crippling of women that originated in
childhood has been described by Landis and Bolles (1942) as resulting in
“hyposexuality” and gross lack of interest in sexual stimulation. Terman
(1951) also noted a trend for more orgastically adequate than inadequate
wives to report “perfect” health since thier marriage.</p>
<h3>Influence of
sex partner on sexual responsiveness</h3>
<p>If this were to be definitely confirmed, it would do much to
establish that a woman’s orgasm adequacy is a relatively self-contained
and independent capacity.</p>
<p>Of 32 items pertaining to the husband’s childhood and family
background, only one differentiated those married to orgastic versus
nonorgastic wives. This one difference was for husbands of the
nonorgastic to report having experienced “exceedingly strict” discipline
more frequently than the husbands of the orgastic wives. There was also
a borderline trend for the husbands or the nonorgastic wives to have had
more strict religious training.</p>
<p>Ratings of husbands by their wives with respect to 14 personality
traits revealed several differences. Orgastic wives more often rated
their husbands as sociable, “better natured”, less moody, more definite
of purpose, and less subject to inferiority feelings. Overall, Terman
felt that his results demonstrated that the wife’s orgastic consistency
was linked only to a minor degree with her husband’s attributes.</p>
<p>Rainwater regarded the limited enjoyment of sex among lower-class
women as a reflection of their poor relationships with their spouses.
This represents an explicit statement that the nature of a woman’s
relationship with her husband plays an important role in her sexual
responsiveness.</p>
<p>At the moment, the burden of proof rests upon
<mark class="highlight1">those who would assign appreciable
importance to the husband’s attitudes and personality in limiting or
enhancing his wife’s orgasm adequacy</mark>.</p>
<p>Hamilton (1929) stated on the basis of his observations that women
with serious difficulty in attaining orgasm rarely improve after a
change in sex partners.</p>
<p><mark class="highlight1">Gebhard (1970) detected a
significant trend for unusually lenghty foreplay (for example, 21
minutes) and unusually lenghty intromission (for example, 16 minutes) to
be accompanied by high orgasm rates. Gebhard felt that only extremely
brief intromission (less than one minute) and extremely lenghty
intromission might significantly influence the wife’s orgasm
consistency</mark>.</p>
<p>Goodrich, Ryder and Raush (1968) study that found that there was less
interest in sexual interaction among those newly married couples in
which the husband continued to maintain close contact with his mother
and father.</p>
<p>Masters and Johnson (1970) <mark class="highlight1">the
dificulty one spouse has in responding sexually is usually a function of
the relationship between the two of them</mark>. Operating within this
perspective, they state that the have significantly helped about 80
percent of women with sexual responsiveness problems.</p>
<h3>Overview</h3>
<p>Such factors as age, religion, degree of religiosity, numbre of
pregnancies, source of sex education and even a variety of maturational
and hormonal indices and perhaps even more surprisingly the attributes
of one’s sex partner have not, except in a few special extreme
categories, been predictive of orgams consistency.</p>
<p>The only significant correlates of responsiveness that have been
demonstrated involve education, social class, practice effects and
perhaps being an only child.</p>
<p>The fact that her responsiveness parallels, to some degree, her
educational level and her social class implies that the broad limits are
particularly a function of social learning. Education and social class
are likely to define the learning of ertain values, standards, and modes
of interpreting the world.</p>
<p>Basically, what the education and social class suggest is that
<mark class="highlight1">women experiencing different kinds
of socialization backgrounds develop different potentialities for
attaining orgasm</mark>.</p>
<h1>Personality and sexual
responsiveness</h1>
<p>In the first of the studies orgastic consistency was not
significantly correlated with reported happiness or parents, attachment
to father or mother, conflict with father or mother, happiness of
childhood, discipline during chidhood and parental attitudes toward
sex.</p>
<p>On the more positive side it was found that the orgastic adequates
exceeded the inadequates in being:</p>
<ul>
<li>Less conforming and more individualistic.</li>
<li>Less willing to drive themselves steadily in their work, and to plan
their work in detail.</li>
<li>More disapproving of methodical work or methodical people.</li>
<li>More motivated to fill “player roles” than “audience roles”.</li>
<li>Less often “grouchy”.</li>
<li>Less often “lonely”.</li>
<li>Less often “miserable”.</li>
<li>More favorable toward practical things and occupations susch as
arithmetic, geometry, physiology, dentistry and policeman than toward
those with “aesthetic” or “sentimental” connotations such as YWCA
worker, poet, magazine writer and music teacher.</li>
</ul>
<p>Terman concluded from the data of the first study that the adequates
differed from the inadequates in being less “neurasthenic”, more
“responsive”, more “vigorous”, more “zestful” and more “colorful” in
personality.</p>
<h2>Passionate vs nonpassionate
wives</h2>
<p>Orgasm consistency was significantly higher in the passionate (12 or
more copulations per moth) than nonpassionate (0-2 copulations per
month) groups. The former also exceeded the latter in having had
premarital intercourse with their spouses, in their amoun of adolescent
petting, in describing themselves as not being puritanical about sex and
in attaining orgasm at time of first intercourse. Passionate
chracteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>To be strongly attached to father and to rate him as above average
in attractiveness.</li>
<li>To report their childhood discipline as mild or irregular.</li>
<li>To describe their childhood happiness as above average.</li>
<li>To marry husbands not physically the “opposite” of their
fathers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Terman: “the passionate wives have the more desirable personality
traits: their feelings are less easily hurt by criticism and they are
less touchy, less often feel miserable, have more self confidence, are
less critical of others and lose their tempers less easily”.</p>
<h2>Wives rated by their
husbands</h2>
<p>In this second study only the husbands of the women were asked to
rate their wives for a number of traits (the women also rated
themselves). Significant trends were found for the husbands of the
adequates to rate their wives as happier and more self-confident and
less possesed of feelings of inferiority than did the husbands of the
inadequates.</p>
<p>The adequates exceeded the inadequates in asserting they were:</p>
<ul>
<li>Not much affected by the praise or blame of many people.</li>
<li>Not frequently burdened by a sense of remorse.</li>
<li>Not often “just miserable”.</li>
<li>Not frequently “grouchy”.</li>
<li>Not often “lonely”.</li>
<li>Not likely to worry “too long over humiliating experiencies”.</li>
<li>Not lacking in self-confidence.</li>
<li>Not usually likely to drive themselves steadily in their work.</li>
<li>Not avoidant of asking others for advice.</li>
<li>Often sought out by others asking for advice.</li>
<li>Inclined to be made discontented by discipline.</li>
<li>Likely to rebel inwardly at orders issued to them when working for
someone.</li>
<li>Likely to feel they were well dressed and making a good
appearance.</li>
<li>Careful to avoid saying things that would hurt the feelings of
others.</li>
<li>Not inclined to find it hard to be optimistic where others are
greatly depressed.</li>
<li>Not likely to make excuses more often than the average person.</li>
</ul>
