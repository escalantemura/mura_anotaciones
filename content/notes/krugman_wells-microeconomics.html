<h1>What Is Economics?</h1>
<h2>The invisible hand</h2>
<p>If you had never seen a market economy in action, you might imagine
  that it would be chaotic. After all, nobody is in charge. But market
  economies are able to coordinate even highly complex activities and
  reliably provide consumers with the goods and services they want.
  Indeed, people quite casually trust their lives to the market system:
  residents of any major city would starve in days if the unplanned yet
  somehow orderly actions of thousands of businesses did not deliver a
  steady supply of food. Surprisingly, the unplanned “chaos” of a market
  economy turns out to be far more orderly than the planning of a command
  economy. And that’s why almost every country in the world—North Korea
  and Cuba are the only exceptions—has become a market economy.</p>
<p>The study of how individuals make decisions and how these decisions
  interact is called <strong>microeconomics</strong>. One of the key themes in microeconomics is the
  validity of Adam Smith’s insight: individuals pursuing their own
  interests often do promote the interests of society as a whole.</p>
<h2>Market failure</h2>
<p>Traffic congestion is a familiar example of a much broader problem: <strong>market failure</strong>, which happens
  when
  the individual pursuit of one’s own interest, instead of promoting the
  interests of society as a whole, actually makes society worse off.
  Another important example of market failure is air pollution, which is
  all too visible, literally, in the PRD. Water pollution and the
  overexploitation of natural resources such as fish and forests reflect
  the same problem.</p>

<ul>
  <li>The economy, as a whole, can produce more when each person
    specializes in a task and trades with others.
  </li>
  <li>Economists say that <em>an economy’s resources are used efficiently
    when they are used in a way that has fully exploited all opportunities
    to make everyone better off.</em> To put it another way, an economy is
    <strong><em>efficient</em></strong> if it takes all opportunities to
    make some people better off without making other people worse off.
  </li>
  <li>The lesson economists learned from the troubles of the 1930s is that
    overall spending—the amount of goods and services that consumers and
    businesses want to buy—sometimes doesn’t match the amount of goods and
    services the economy is capable of producing. In the 1930s, spending
    fell far short of what was needed to keep American workers employed, and
    the result was a severe economic slump. In fact, shortfalls in spending
    are responsible for most, though not all, recessions.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Economics models:
  Trade-offs and trade</h2>
<p>Although the production possibility frontier helps clarify what it
  means for an economy to be efficient in production, it’s important to
  understand that efficiency in production is only part of what’s required
  for the economy as a whole to be efficient. Efficiency also requires
  that the economy allocate its resources so that consumers are as well
  off as possible. If an economy does this, we say that it is efficient in
  allocation.</p>
<p>To see why efficiency in allocation is as important as efficiency in
  production, notice that points A and B in Figure 2-1 both represent
  situations in which the economy is efficient in production, because in
  each case it can’t produce more of one good without producing less of
  the other. But these two situations may not be equally desirable from
  society’s point of view. Suppose that society prefers to have more small
  jets and fewer Dreamliners than at point A; say, it prefers to have 28
  small jets and 9 Dreamliners, corresponding to point B. In this case,
  point A is inefficient in allocation from the point of view of the
  economy as a whole because it would rather have Boeing produce at point
  B instead of point A.</p>
<h2>Economic growth</h2>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Titulo" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-growth.jpg">
</figure>
<p>As a result, the additional corn production involves sacrificing
  considerably more wheat production. In other words, as more of a good is
  produced, its opportunity cost typically rises because well-suited
  inputs are used up and less adaptable inputs must be used instead.</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Titulo" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-growth2.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Economic growth results in an outward shift of the production
  possibility frontier because production possibilities are expanded. The
  economy can now produce more of everything. For example, if production
  is initially at point A (25 Dreamliners and 20 small jets), economic
  growth means that the economy could move to point E (30 Dreamliners and
  25 small jets).</p>
<h2>Comparative
  Advantage and Gains from Trade</h2>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Four factors" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-fourfactors.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Broadly speaking, the main factors of production are the
  resources</p>
<ol>
  <li>land,</li>
  <li>labor,</li>
  <li>physical capital,</li>
  <li>and human capital.</li>
</ol>
<p>Land is a resource supplied by nature; labor is the economy’s pool of
  workers; physical capital refers to created resources such as machines
  and buildings; and human capital refers to the educational achievements
  and skills of the labor force, which enhance its productivity. Of
  course, each of these is really a category rather than a single factor:
  land in North Dakota is quite different from land in Florida.</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="US Production" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-usproduction.jpg">
</figure>
<p>By specializing and trading, the United States and Brazil can produce
  and consume more of both large jets and small jets. The United States
  specializes in manufacturing large jets, its comparative advantage, and
  Brazil—which has an absolute disadvantage in both goods but a
  comparative advantage in small jets—specializes in manufacturing small
  jets. With trade, both countries can consume more of both goods than
  either could without trade.</p>
<p>A country has an <strong>absolute advantage</strong> in producing a
  good or service if the country can produce more output per worker than
  other countries. L ikewise, an individual has an absolute advantage in
  producing a good or service if he or she is better at producing it than
  other people. Having an absolute advantage is not the same thing as
  having a comparative advantage.</p>
<p>But we’ve just seen that the United States can indeed benefit from
  trading with Brazil because <strong>comparative, not absolute,
    advantage is the basis for mutual gain.</strong> It doesn’t matter
  whether it takes Brazil more resources than the United States to make a
  small jet; what matters for trade is that for Brazil the opportunity
  cost of a small jet is lower than the U.S. opportunity cost. So Brazil,
  despite its absolute disadvantage, even in small jets, has a comparative
  advantage in the manufacture of small jets. Meanwhile the United States,
  which can use its resources most productively by manufacturing large
  jets, has a comparative <em>dis</em> advantage in manufacturing small
  jets.</p>
<h1>Supply and Demand</h1>
<h2>Demand curve</h2>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Demand curve" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-demandcurve.jpg">
</figure>
<p>It’s crucial to make the distinction between such shifts of the
  demand curve and movements along the demand curve, changes in the
  quantity demanded of a good arising from a change in that good’s price.
  Figure 3-3 illustrates the difference.</p>
<ol>
  <li>A <strong>shift of the demand curve</strong> is a change in the
    <u>quantity demanded</u> at any given price, represented by the shift of
    the original demand curve to a new position, denoted by a new demand
    curve.
  </li>
  <li>A <strong>movement along the demand curve</strong> is a change in
    the quantity demanded of a good arising from a change in the <u>good’s
      price</u>.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Economists believe that there are five principal factors that shift
  the demand curve for a good or service:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Changes in the prices of related goods or services</li>
  <li>Changes in income</li>
  <li>Changes in tastes</li>
  <li>Changes in expectations</li>
  <li>Changes in the number of consumers</li>
</ol>
<h2>Supply curve</h2>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Suply curve" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-suplycurve.jpg">
</figure>
<p>So just as the quantity of natural gas that consumers want to buy
  depends upon the price they have to pay, the quantity that producers of
  natural gas, or of any good or service, are willing to produce and
  sell—the <strong>quantity supplied</strong> —depends upon the price they
  are offered.</p>
<ol>
  <li><p>A <strong>shift of the supply curve</strong> is a change in the
    <u>quantity supplied</u> of a good or service at any given price. It is
    represented by the change of the original supply curve to a new
    position, denoted by a new supply curve.</p></li>
  <li><p>A <strong>movement along the supply curve</strong> is a change in
    the quantity supplied of a good arising from a change in the <u>good’s
      price</u>. Economists believe that shifts of the supply curve for a good
    or service are mainly the result of five factors (though, as with
    demand, there are other possible causes):</p></li>
  <li><p>Changes in input prices</p></li>
  <li><p>Changes in the prices of related goods or services</p></li>
  <li><p>Changes in technology</p></li>
  <li><p>Changes in expectations</p></li>
  <li><p>Changes in the number of producers</p></li>
</ol>
<p>A single producer often produces a mix of goods rather than a single
  product. For example, an oil refinery produces gasoline from crude oil,
  but it also produces heating oil and other products from the same raw
  material. When a producer sells several products, the quantity of any
  one good it is willing to supply at any given price depends on the
  prices of its other co-produced goods.</p>
<p>This effect can run in either direction. An oil refiner will supply
  less gasoline at any given price when the price of heating oil rises,
  shifting the supply curve for gasoline to the left. But it will supply
  more gasoline at any given price when the price of heating oil falls,
  shifting the supply curve for gasoline to the right. This means that
  gasoline and other co-produced oil products are <strong>substitutes in
    production</strong> for refiners.</p>
<p>In contrast, due to the nature of the production process, other goods
  can be <strong>complements in production</strong>. Producers of natural
  gas often find that natural gas wells also produce oil as a by-product
  of extraction. The higher the price at which a driller can sell its oil,
  the more willing it will be to drill natural gas wells and the more
  natural gas it will supply at any given price. Higher oil prices then
  lead to more natural gas supplied at any given price because oil and
  natural gas can be tapped simultaneously. As a result, oil is a
  complement in the production of natural gas. The reverse is also true:
  natural gas is a complement in the production of oil.</p>
<h2>Supply, Demand, and
  Equilibrium</h2>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Equilibrium" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-equilibrium.jpg">
</figure>
<p>The price that matches the quantity supplied and the quantity
  demanded is the <strong>equilibrium price</strong> ; the quantity bought
  and sold at that price is the <strong>equilibrium quantity</strong>. The
  equilibrium price is also known as the <strong>market-clearing
    price</strong> : it is the price that “clears the market” by ensuring
  that every buyer willing to pay that price finds a seller willing to
  sell at that price, and vice versa. So how do we find the equilibrium
  price and quantity?</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a <strong>surplus</strong> of a good or service when the
    quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded. Surpluses occur when
    the price is above its equilibrium level.
  </li>
  <li>There is a <strong>shortage</strong> of a good or service when the
    quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. Shortages occur when
    the price is below its equilibrium level.
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Willingness to Pay and
  Consumer Surplus</h2>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Willigness to pay" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-willingnesstopay.jpg">
</figure>
<p>At a price of $30, Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia each buy a book but
  Darren and Edwina do not. Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia receive individual
  consumer surpluses equal to the difference between their willingness to
  pay and the price, illustrated by the areas of the shaded rectangles.
  Both Darren and Edwina have a willingness to pay less than $30, so they
  are unwilling to buy a book in this market; they receive zero consumer
  surplus. The total consumer surplus is given by the entire shaded
  area—the sum of the individual consumer surpluses of Aleisha, Brad, and
  Claudia—equal to <span class="ecuacion-inline">\(\$29 + \$15 + \$5 = \$49.\)</span></p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Consumer surplus" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-consumersurplus.jpg">
</figure>
<p>The <strong>total consumer surplus</strong> achieved in this market
  is just the sum of the individual consumer surpluses received by
  Aleisha, Brad, and Claudia. So total consumer surplus is equal to the
  combined area of the three rectangles—the entire shaded area in Figure
  4-2. Another way to say this is that total consumer surplus is equal to
  the area below the demand curve but above the price.</p>
<p>
  <mark class="highlight1">The point is that efficiency is
    about <i>how to achieve goals, not what those goals should
      be</i>.
  </mark>
  For example, UNOS decided that its goal is to maximize
  the life span of kidney recipients. Some might have argued for a
  different goal, and efficiency does not address which goal is the best.
  <em>What efficiency does address is the best way to achieve a goal once
    it has been determined</em>—in this case, using the UNOS concept of net
  survival benefit.
</p>
<h2>Market economy</h2>
<p>An <strong>economic signal</strong> is any piece of information that
  helps people and businesses make better economic decisions. For example,
  business forecasters say that sales of cardboard boxes are a good early
  indicator of changes in industrial production: if businesses are buying
  lots of cardboard boxes, you can be sure that they will soon increase
  their production.</p>
<p>When markets are <strong>inefficient</strong> , there are missed
  opportunities—ways in which production or consumption can be rearranged
  that would make some people better off without making other people worse
  off. In other words, there are gains from trade that go unrealized:
  total surplus could be increased. And when a market or markets are
  inefficient, the economy in which they are embedded is also
  inefficient.</p>
<p>Markets can be rendered inefficient for a number of reasons. Two of
  the most important are a lack of property rights and inaccuracy of
  prices as economic signals. When a market is inefficient, we have what
  is known as <strong>market failure</strong>. We will examine various
  types of market failure in later chapters. For now, let’s review the
  three main ways in which markets sometimes fall short of efficiency.</p>
<ol>
  <li><em>Market Power:</em> Markets can fail due to <em>market
    power,</em> which occurs when a firm has the ability to raise the market
    price. In this case the assumption that underlies supply and demand
    analysis—that no one can have a noticeable effect on the market price—is
    no longer valid. As we’ll see in Chapter 13, the presence of market
    power leads to inefficiency as the firm manipulates the market price in
    order to increase profits and thereby prevents mutually beneficial
    trades from occurring.
  </li>
  <li><em>Externalities:</em> Markets can fail due to
    <em>externalities,</em> which arise when actions have side effects on
    the welfare of others. The most common example of an externality is
    pollution. Because the market price doesn’t capture the negative effect
    pollution has on others, the market outcome is inefficient. In Chapter
    16 we’ll learn more about externalities and how societies try to cope
    with them.
  </li>
  <li><em>Public Goods, Common Resources, and Private Information:</em>
    Markets can fail when the nature of the good makes it unsuitable for
    efficient allocation by the market. National defense is an example of a
    public good—it cannot be bought and sold among people, so a market can’t
    allocate it efficiently. In Chapters 17 and 20 we will learn how society
    copes in these situations.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Price Controls and Quotas</h2>
<p>Price controls are legal restrictions on how high or low a market
  price may go. They can take two forms: a price ceiling, a maximum price
  sellers are allowed to charge for a good or service, or a price floor, a
  minimum price buyers are required to pay for a good or service.</p>
<h3> Price Ceilings</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Price control" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-pricecontrol.jpg">
</figure>
<ol>
  <li>Inefficiently Low Quantity: <strong>Deadweight loss</strong> is the
    loss in total surplus that occurs whenever an action or a policy reduces
    the quantity transacted below the efficient market equilibrium
    quantity.<br>Price ceilings often lead to inefficiency in that the goods
    being offered are of <strong>inefficiently low quality</strong> :
    sellers offer low-quality goods at a low price even though buyers would
    prefer a higher quality at a higher price.
  </li>
  <li>Inefficient Allocation to Consumers: Price ceilings often lead to
    inefficiency in the form of inefficient allocation to consumers: some
    people who want the good badly and are willing to pay a high price don’t
    get it, and some who care relatively little about the good and are only
    willing to pay a low price do get it.
  </li>
  <li>Wasted Resources: Price ceilings typically lead to inefficiency in
    the form of wasted resources: people expend money, effort, and time to
    cope with the shortages caused by the price ceiling.
  </li>
  <li>Black Markets: A black market is a market in which goods or services
    are bought and sold illegally—either because it is illegal to sell them
    at all or because the prices charged are legally prohibited by a price
    ceiling.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Price Floors</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Price floor" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-pricefloor.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Sometimes governments intervene to push market prices up instead of
  down. <em>Price floors</em> have been widely legislated for agricultural
  products, such as wheat and milk, as a way to support the incomes of
  farmers. Historically, there were also price floors—legally mandated
  minimum prices—on such services as trucking and air travel, although
  these were phased out by the U.S. government in the 1970s.</p>
<p>If you have ever worked in a fast-food restaurant, you are likely to
  have encountered a price floor: governments in the United States and
  many other countries maintain a lower limit on the hourly wage rate of a
  worker’s labor; that is, a floor on the price of labor called the
  <strong>minimum wage</strong>.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Inefficiently Low Quantity: Because a price floor raises the price
    of a good to consumers, it reduces the quantity of that good demanded;
    because sellers can’t sell more units of a good than buyers are willing
    to buy, a price floor reduces the quantity of a good bought and sold
    below the market equilibrium quantity and leads to a deadweight loss.
    Notice that this is the <em>same</em> effect as a price ceiling. You
    might be tempted to think that a price floor and a price ceiling have
    opposite effects, but both have the effect of reducing the quantity of a
    good bought and sold (see the accompanying Pitfalls).
  </li>
  <li>Inefficient Allocation of Sales Among Sellers: Like a price ceiling,
    a price floor can lead to inefficient allocation—in this case, an
    inefficient allocation of sales among sellers: sellers who are willing
    to sell at the lowest price are unable to make sales, while sales go to
    sellers who are only willing to sell at a higher price.
  </li>
  <li>Wasted Resources: Price floors also lead to wasted time and effort.
    Consider the minimum wage. Would-be workers who spend many hours
    searching for jobs, or waiting in line in the hope of getting jobs, play
    the same role in the case of price floors as hapless families searching
    for apartments in the case of price ceilings.
  </li>
  <li>Inefficiently High Quality: Price floors often lead to inefficiency
    in that goods of inefficiently high quality are offered: sellers offer
    high-quality goods at a high price, even though buyers would prefer a
    lower quality at a lower price.
  </li>
  <li>Illegal Activity: In addition to the four inefficiencies we
    analyzed, like price ceilings, price floors provide incentives for
    illegal activity. For example, in countries where the minimum wage is
    far above the equilibrium wage rate, workers desperate for jobs
    sometimes agree to work off the books for employers who conceal their
    employment from the government—or bribe the government inspectors. This
    practice, known in Europe as <em>black labor</em>, is especially common
    in Southern European countries such as Italy and Spain.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Controlling Quantities</h3>
<p>A quantity control, or quota, is an upper limit on the quantity of
  some good that can be bought or sold. The total amount of the good that
  can be legally transacted is the quota limit. A license gives its owner
  the right to supply a good.</p>
<p>A taxi medallion is a form of quantity control, or quota, by which
  the government regulates the quantity of a good that can be bought and
  sold rather than the price at which it is transacted. It is another way
  that government intervenes in markets along with price ceilings and
  price floors.</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Dead weight loss" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-deadweightloss.jpg">
</figure>
<p>The total amount of the good that can be transacted under the
  quantity control is called the quota limit. Typically, the government
  limits quantity in a market by issuing licenses; only people with a
  license can legally supply the good.</p>
<p>A quantity control, or quota, drives a <strong>wedge</strong> between
  the demand price and the supply price of a good; that is, the price paid
  by buyers ends up being higher than that received by sellers.</p>
<p>The difference between the demand and supply price at the quota limit
  is the <strong>quota rent</strong> , the earnings that accrue to the
  license-holder from ownership of the right to sell the good. It is equal
  to the market price of the license when the licenses are traded.</p>
<h2>Elasticity</h2>
<h3>Demand elasticity</h3>
<p>The <strong>price elasticity of demand</strong> is the ratio of the
  percent change in quantity demanded to the percent change in price as we
  move along the demand curve. As we’ll see later in this chapter, the
  reason economists use percent changes is to obtain a measure that
  doesn’t depend on the units in which a good is measured (say, a 1-mile
  ambulance trip versus a 10-mile ambulance trip). But before we get to
  that, let’s look at how elasticity is calculated.</p>
<p>To calculate the price elasticity of demand, we find the ratio of the
  percent change in the quantity demanded to the percent change in the
  price:</p>
<figure class="ecuacion">
  $$\text{Price elasticity of demand} = \left| \frac{\% \text{ change in quantity demanded}}{\% \text{ change in
  price}} \right|$$

<p>Demand is elastic if the price elasticity of demand is greater than
  1, inelastic if the price elasticity of demand is less than 1, and
  unit-elastic if the price elasticity of demand is exactly 1.</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Elasticity2" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-elasticity2.jpg">
</figure>
<p>If the quantity effect, which tends to reduce total revenue, is the
  stronger, then total revenue goes down. And if the strengths of the two
  effects are exactly equal—as in our toll bridge example, where a $180
  gain offsets a $180 loss—total revenue is unchanged by the price
  increase.</p>
<p>The price elasticity of demand tells us what happens to total revenue
  when price changes: its size determines which effect—the price effect or
  the quantity effect—is stronger. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If demand for a good is unit-elastic (the price elasticity of demand
    is 1), an increase in price does not change total revenue. In this case,
    the quantity effect and the price effect exactly offset each other.
  </li>
  <li>If demand for a good is inelastic (the price elasticity of demand is
    less than 1), a higher price increases total revenue. In this case, the
    quantity effect is weaker than the price effect.
  </li>
  <li>If demand for a good is elastic (the price elasticity of demand is
    greater than 1), an increase in price reduces total revenue. In this
    case, the quantity effect is stronger than the price effect.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>There is the price effect of a lower price per unit sold, which tends
  to lower revenue. This is countered by the quantity effect of more units
  sold, which tends to raise revenue. Which effect dominates depends on
  the price elasticity. Here is a quick summary:</p>
<ul>
  <li>When demand is unit-elastic, the two effects exactly balance; so a
    fall in price has no effect on total revenue.
  </li>
  <li>When demand is inelastic, the quantity effect is dominated by the
    price effect; so a fall in price reduces total revenue.
  </li>
  <li>When demand is elastic, the quantity effect dominates the price
    effect; so a fall in price increases total revenue.
  </li>
</ul>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Elasticity3" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-elasticity3.jpg">
</figure>
<p>In Figure 6-5, you can see that when the price is low, raising the
  price increases total revenue: starting at a price of $1, raising the
  price to $2 increases total revenue from $9 to $16. This means that when
  the price is low, demand is inelastic. Moreover, you can see that demand
  is inelastic on the entire section of the demand curve from a price of
  $0 to a price of $5.</p>
<p>When the price is high, however, raising it further reduces total
  revenue: starting at a price of $8, raising the price to $9 reduces
  total revenue, from $16 to $9. This means that when the price is high,
  demand is elastic. Furthermore, you can see that demand is elastic over
  the section of the demand curve from a price of $5 to $10.</p>
<p>For the vast majority of goods, the price elasticity of demand
  changes along the demand curve. So whenever you measure a good’s
  elasticity, you are really measuring it at a particular point or section
  of the good’s demand curve.</p>
<h4>What
  Factors Determine the Price Elasticity of Demand?</h4>
<p>In general there are four main factors that determine elasticity:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Whether a good is a necessity or luxury: The price elasticity of
    demand tends to be high if the good is a luxury—something you can easily
    live without. For example, most people would consider a 110-inch
    ultra-high-definition TV a luxury—nice to have, but something they can
    live without.
  </li>
  <li>The availability of close substitutes: As we just noted, the price
    elasticity of demand tends to be low if there are no close substitutes
    or if they are very difficult to obtain. In contrast, the price
    elasticity of demand tends to be high if there are other readily
    available goods that consumers regard as similar and would be willing to
    consume instead.
  </li>
  <li>The share of income a consumer spends on the good: As a result, when
    the price of gasoline goes up, these consumers are likely to be very
    responsive to the price change and have a higher elasticity of demand.
    Why? Because when the good absorbs a significant share of these
    consumers’ income, it is worth their time and effort to find a way to
    reduce their demand when the price goes up—such as switching to
    car-pooling instead of driving alone. In contrast, people who consume
    gasoline infrequently—for example, people who walk to work or take the
    bus—will have a low share of income spent on gasoline and therefore a
    lower elasticity of demand.
  </li>
  <li>How much time has elapsed since a change in price: In general, the
    price elasticity of demand tends to increase as consumers have more time
    to adjust. This means that the long-run price elasticity of demand is
    often higher than the short-run elasticity.
  </li>
</ol>
<h4>Other Demand Elasticities</h4>
<p>The <strong>cross-price elasticity of demand</strong> between two
  goods measures the effect of the change in one good’s price on the
  quantity demanded of the other good. It is equal to the percent change
  in the quantity demanded of one good divided by the percent change in
  the other good’s price.</p>
<figure class="ecuacion">
  $$\text{Cross-price elasticity of demand} = \frac{\% \text{ change in
  quantity of A demanded}}{\% \text{ change in price of B}}$$
</figure>
<p>The <strong>income elasticity of demand</strong> is the percent
  change in the quantity of a good demanded when a consumer’s income
  changes divided by the percent change in the consumer’s income.</p>
<figure class="ecuacion">
  $$\text{Income elasticity of demand} = \frac{\% \text{ change in quantity
  demanded}}{\% \text{ change in income}}$$
</figure>
<h3>The Price Elasticity of
  Supply</h3>
<p>The price elasticity of supply is a measure of the responsiveness of
  the quantity of a good supplied to the price of that good. It is the
  ratio of the percent change in the quantity supplied to the percent
  change in the price as we move along the supply curve.</p>
<figure class="ecuacion">
  $$\text{Price elasticity of supply} = \frac{\% \text{ change in quantity
  supplied}}{\% \text{ change in price}}$$
</figure>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Elasticity4" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-elasticity4.jpg">
</figure>
<p>There is perfectly <strong>inelastic</strong> supply when the price
  elasticity of supply is zero, so that changes in the price of the good
  have no effect on the quantity supplied. A perfectly inelastic supply
  curve is a vertical line.</p>
<p>There is perfectly <strong>elastic</strong> supply when even a tiny
  increase or reduction in the price will lead to very large changes in
  the quantity supplied, so that the price elasticity of supply is
  infinite. A perfectly elastic supply curve is a horizontal line.</p>
<h4>What
  Factors Determine the Price Elasticity of Supply?</h4>
<ol>
  <li>The Availability of Inputs: The price elasticity of supply tends to
    be large when inputs are readily available and can be shifted into and
    out of production at a relatively low cost. It tends to be small when
    inputs are difficult to obtain—and can be shifted into and out of
    production only at a relatively high cost.
  </li>
  <li>Time: The price elasticity of supply tends to grow larger as
    producers have more time to respond to a price change. This means that
    the long-run price elasticity of supply is often higher than the
    short-run elasticity.
  </li>
</ol>

<h1>Individuals and Markets</h1>
<h2>Taxes</h2>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Taxes" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-taxes.jpg">
</figure>
<p>An <strong>excise tax</strong> is a tax on sales of a good or
  service.</p>
<p>This insight illustrates a general principle of the economics of
  taxation: the incidence of a tax—who really bears the burden of the
  tax—is typically not a question you can answer by asking who writes the
  check to the government. In this particular case, a $40 tax on hotel
  rooms is reflected in a $20 increase in the price paid by consumers and
  a $20 decrease in the price received by producers. Here, regardless of
  whether the tax is levied on consumers or producers, the incidence of
  the tax is evenly split between them.</p>
<p>The <strong>incidence</strong> <strong>of a tax</strong> is a measure
  of who really pays it.</p>
<p><em>More specifically, the incidence of an excise tax depends on the
  price elasticity of supply and the price elasticity of demand.</em></p>
<h3>Excise Tax Paid Mainly by
  Consumers</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Excise taxes" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-excisetaxes.jpg">
</figure>
<p>This example illustrates another general principle of taxation:
  <strong><em>When the price elasticity of demand is low and the price
    elasticity of supply is high, the burden of an excise tax falls mainly
    on consumers</em></strong>. Why? A low-price elasticity of demand means
  that consumers have few substitutes, and therefore little alternative to
  buying higher-priced gasoline. In contrast, a high price elasticity of
  supply results from the fact that producers have many production
  substitutes for their gasoline (that is, other uses for the crude oil
  from which gasoline is refined).</p>
<h3>Excise Tax Is Paid
  Mainly by Producers</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Excise taxes 2" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-excisetaxes2.jpg">
</figure>
<p><strong><em>When the price elasticity of demand is high and the price
  elasticity of supply is low, the burden of an excise tax falls mainly on
  producers.</em></strong> A real-world example is a tax on purchases of
  existing houses. Before the collapse of the housing market that began in
  2007, house prices in many American cities and towns rose significantly,
  as well-off outsiders moved into desirable locations and purchased homes
  from the less-well-off original occupants.</p>
<ul>
  <li>When the price elasticity of demand is higher than the price
    elasticity of supply, an excise tax falls mainly on producers.
  </li>
  <li>When the price elasticity of supply is higher than the price
    elasticity of demand, an excise tax falls mainly on consumers.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>The Revenue from an Excise
  Tax</h3>
<p>The revenue collected by an excise tax is equal to the area of the
  rectangle whose height is the tax wedge between the supply and demand
  curves and whose width is the quantity transacted under the tax.</p>
<p>The revenue from a $40 excise tax on hotel rooms is $200,000, equal
  to the tax rate, $40 —the size of the wedge that the tax drives between
  the supply price and the demand price—multiplied by the number of rooms
  rented, 5,000. This is equal to the area of the shaded rectangle. The
  tax revenue collected is:</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Excise taxes 3" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-excisetaxes3.jpg">
</figure>
<figure class="ecuacion">
  $$\text{Tax revenue}= $40 \text{ per room} × 5,000 \text{ rooms} =
  $200,000$$
</figure>
<figure class="ecuacion">
  $$Area = Height × Width = $40 \text{ per room} × 5,000 \text{ rooms} =
  $200,000$$
</figure>
<figure class="ecuacion">
  $$\text{Tax revenue} = \text{Area of shaded rectangle}$$
</figure>
<p>This is also <em>less</em> than the revenue collected by a $40 per
  room tax. So raising the tax rate from $40 to $60 actually reduces
  revenue. More precisely, in this case raising the tax rate by 50% <span class="math inline">\(((\$ 60 - \$ 40) / \$ 40 × 100 = 50\%)\)</span>
  lowers the tax revenue by 25% <span class="math inline">\(((\$150,000 -
\$ 200,000)/ \$ 200,000 × 100 = -25\%)\)</span>. Why did this happen?
  Because the fall in tax revenue caused by the reduction in the number of
  rooms rented more than offset the increase in the tax revenue caused by
  the rise in the tax rate. In other words, setting a tax rate so high
  that it deters a significant number of transactions will likely lead to
  a fall in tax revenue.</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Excise taxes 4" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-excisetaxes4.jpg">
</figure>
<p>In general, doubling the excise tax rate on a good or service won’t
  double the amount of revenue collected, because the tax increase will
  reduce the quantity of the good or service bought and sold. And the
  relationship between the level of the tax and the amount of revenue
  collected may not even be positive.</p>
<h3>Tax Reduces Consumer
  and Producer Surplus</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Excise taxes 5" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-excisetaxes5.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Before the tax, the equilibrium price and quantity are
  <em>P<sub>E</sub> and</em> <em>Q<sub>E</sub>, respectively. After an
    excise tax of</em> <em>T</em> per unit is imposed, the price to
  consumers rises to <em>P<sub>C</sub> and consumer surplus falls by the
    sum of the dark blue rectangle, labeled</em> <em>A,</em> and the light
  blue triangle, labeled <em>B.</em></p>
<p>The tax also causes the price to producers to fall to P<sub>P</sub>;
  producer surplus falls by the sum of the red rectangle, labeled
  <em>C,</em> and the pink triangle, labeled <em>F.</em> The government
  receives revenue from the tax equal to <em>Q</em><sub>T</sub> ×
  <em>T</em>, which is given by the sum of the areas <em>A</em> and
  <em>C.</em> Areas <em>B</em> and <em>F</em> represent the losses to
  consumer and producer surplus that are not collected by the government
  as revenue. They are the deadweight loss to society of the tax.</p>
<h3>The Deadweight Loss of a Tax</h3>
<p>A tax leads to a deadweight loss because it creates inefficiency:
  some mutually beneficial transactions never take place because of the
  tax—namely, the transactions <em>Q<sub>E</sub> – Q<sub>T</sub>. The
    yellow area here represents the value of the deadweight loss: it is the
    total surplus that would have been gained from the</em>
  <em>Q</em><sub>E</sub> – <em>Q</em><sub>T</sub> transactions. If the tax
  had not discouraged transactions—had the number of transactions remained
  at Q<sub>E</sub> because of either perfectly inelastic supply or
  perfectly inelastic demand—no deadweight loss would have been
  incurred.</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Excise taxes 6" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-excisetaxes6.jpg">
</figure>
<h3>Administrative costs</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Administrative cost" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-administrativecost.jpg">
</figure>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="Administrative cost 2" src="../../img/notes/content/krugmanmicroeconomics-administrativecost2.jpg">
</figure>
<p>In considering the total amount of inefficiency caused by a tax, we
  must also take into account something not shown in Figure 7-9: the
  resources actually used by the government to collect the tax, and by
  taxpayers to pay it, over and above the amount of the tax. These lost
  resources are called the administrative costs of the tax. The most
  familiar administrative cost of the U.S. tax system is the time
  individuals spend filling out their income tax forms or the money they
  pay for tax return preparation services like those provided by H&amp;R
  Block and companies like it. (The latter is considered an inefficiency
  from the point of view of society because resources spent on return
  preparation could be used for other, non-tax-related purposes.)</p>
<p>The administrative costs of a tax are the resources used for its
  collection, for the method of payment, and for any attempts to evade the
  tax.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Included in the administrative costs that taxpayers incur are
    resources used to evade the tax, both legally and illegally.
  </li>
  <li>The costs of operating the Internal Revenue Service, the arm of the
    federal government tasked with collecting the federal income tax, are
    actually quite small in comparison to the administrative costs paid by
    taxpayers.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>So the total inefficiency caused by a tax is the sum of its
  deadweight loss and its administrative costs. The general rule for
  economic policy is that, other things equal, a tax system should be
  designed to minimize the total inefficiency it imposes on society. In
  practice, other considerations also apply (as the Washington
  administration learned during the Whiskey Rebellion), but this principle
  nonetheless gives valuable guidance. Administrative costs are usually
  well known, more or less determined by the current technology of
  collecting taxes (for example, filing paper returns versus filing
  electronically).</p>
<figure class="ecuacion">
  $$\text{Total inefficiency tax caused} = \text{Deadweight loss} +
  \text{Administrative costs}$$
</figure>
<h3>Elasticities and
  the Deadweight Loss of a Tax</h3>
<p>We know that the deadweight loss from an excise tax arises because it
  prevents some mutually beneficial transactions from occurring. In
  particular, the producer and consumer surplus that is forgone because of
  these missing transactions is equal to the size of the deadweight loss
  itself. This means that the larger the number of transactions that are
  prevented by the tax, the larger the deadweight loss.</p>
<p>Demand is elastic in panel (a) and inelastic in panel (b), but the
  supply curves are the same. Supply is elastic in panel (c) and inelastic
  in panel (d), but the demand curves are the same. The deadweight losses
  are larger in panels (a) and (c) than in panels (b) and (d) because the
  greater the price elasticity of demand or supply, the greater the
  tax-induced fall in the quantity transacted. In contrast, the lower the
  price elasticity of demand or supply, the smaller the tax-induced fall
  in the quantity transacted and the smaller the deadweight loss.</p>
<p>The implication of this result is clear: <strong>if you want to
  minimize the efficiency costs of taxation, you should choose to tax only
  those goods for which demand or supply, or both, is relatively
  inelastic</strong>. For such goods, a tax has little effect on behavior
  because behavior is relatively unresponsive to changes in the price. In
  the extreme case in which demand is perfectly inelastic (a vertical
  demand curve), the quantity demanded is unchanged by the imposition of
  the tax. As a result, the tax imposes no deadweight loss. Similarly, if
  supply is perfectly inelastic (a vertical supply curve), the quantity
  supplied is unchanged by the tax and there is also no deadweight
  loss.</p>
