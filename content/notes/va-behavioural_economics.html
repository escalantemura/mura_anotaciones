<h1>The context effect</h1>
<p>How context affects human decision making.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The default effect: The default option is the most elected because
    changing costs effort and also it has a popular tendency.
  </li>
  <li>The action-implementation gap: The gap between the things people
    wants and the actions in order to make them real.
  </li>
  <li>The compromise effect: The middle option.</li>

      An axiom is a proposition that is considered to be
      self-evident. Its truth is taken for granted, and serves as a starting
      point for deducing and inferring other (theory dependent)
      truths.

<h1>Theory of decision points</h1>
<p>A decision point is any intervention that is designed to get an
  individual to ‘pause and think’ about the consumption they are currently
  engaged in. There are a number of ways in which decision points can be
  created, but there are three broad methods:</p>
<ol>
  <li>inserting transaction costs (which work on the premise that
    requiring the individual to take a positive action makes them deliberate
    on the consumption decision);
  </li>
  <li>providing reminders or information (which work on the premise that
    drawing attention to a neglected activity can provide the impetus to get
    it done with); and
  </li>
  <li>creating interruptions to the consumption activity (which work on
    the premise that the interruption allows the individual to pause and
    think).
  </li>
</ol>
<p>We propose that individuals start consumption in a deliberative mode
  in which they actually think explicitly about the pros and cons of
  consuming. However, once they start, they quickly shift into automatic
  mode, where continued consumption becomes mindless and habitual. The
  provision of a decision point can enable the individual to snap back
  into a deliberative mode.</p>
<p>In <strong>Thaler and Shefrin’s model</strong>, the planner controls
  the doer’s desire through willpower. In general, the model suggests that
  when people are asked about their preferences, their planner comes forth
  and they respond with a should option. However, when they are faced with
  a tempting opportunity, the doer comes forth and pushes the individual
  towards the want option.</p>
<h2>Partitioning and Decision
  Points</h2>
<p>One easy method of creating a decision point is to partition the
  quantity of resources to be consumed into smaller units, such that there
  is a very small transaction cost that needs to be incurred before
  consumption can continue. While the transaction cost itself need not be
  very high, it works because it creates an interruption and provides an
  opportunity for the sophisticate to move to a deliberative mode and make
  a decision to stop consuming.</p>
<h2>Transaction Costs and
  Decision Points</h2>
<p>While partitioning is a good intervention to create decision points
  for fixed tangible quantities of resources, the general idea of using
  small transaction costs to interrupt consumption can be used more
  broadly.</p>

<h1>Mental accounting</h1>
<p>Mental accounting is the set of cognitive operations used by
  individuals and households to organize, evaluate, and keep track of
  financial activities</p>
<ul>
  <li>Metering: People need to keep track (remember, record) expenses</li>
  <li>Categorizing: They need to create meaningful and relevant categories
    over which to budget
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Basis of Categorizing</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Sources of Income: Money earned from work is spent differently from
    money earned as a gift; salaries are spent differently from bonuses
  </li>
  <li>Spending Categories: Budgets are set as a function of spending
    category, e.g. Food, entertainment, shopping (remember the budgeting
    jars!)
  </li>
  <li>Time: Weekly, monthly or annual budgets</li>
  <li>Individual Transactions: Tracking is done over individual
    transactions (e.g., symphony, ticket to a basketball game)
  </li>
</ul>
<h2>Mental Accounting Effects</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Overconsuming and Underconsuming: Sometimes people / organizations
    consume categories they don’t really need or want, simply because they
    have excess budget. Conversely, they may underconsume if they have
    limited budgets.
  </li>
  <li>Sunk Cost Effect: People are driven to consume what they have
    prepaid for, even when it makes little sense to do so.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>When you want people to consume, highlight the cost they have already
  incurred.</p>
<p>Conversely, when you would like them to forego consumption, mask the
  cost. This could be done through transaction formats, timing, or
  currency.</p>
<p>Designating money towards a particular purpose makes it more likely
  to be spent on that purpose</p>
<p>A match between the source of funds (e.g., cash won in a lottery) and
  use (e.g., a vacation) increases the likelihood or spending.</p>
<h1>Choice overload</h1>
<p>When people are given a lot of choices they:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Deferral and non-participation; people simply decide they do not
    want to make a purchase now.
  </li>
  <li>The nature of choices made: a smaller choice set encourages varied
    and perhaps aggressive / risky choices, while a complex choice might
    result in a smaller number of conservative choices with a view to
    minimizing regret.
  </li>
  <li>Status quo and the increasing role of defaults and suggestions: When
    choices are too complex, people simply prefer to go with a default
    option.
  </li>
  <li>People also tend to use others’ choices as a heuristic to what they
    should choose. For instance, employees in matching retirement programs
    tend to have fund allocations that are close to the median of their peer
    group.
  </li>
  <li>Defection: In the world of marketing, we found that a brand that has
    a large number of variants runs the risk of losing share to one that has
    a more streamlined set of offerings.
  </li>
</ol>
<h2>Solutions</h2>
<p><strong>Streamline choices.</strong> A number of organizations have
  streamlined choices in response to the concerns about choice complexity.
  In recent years, <strong>Procter &amp; Gamble </strong> has taken to
  rationalizing its product lines in many packaged-good categories. In an
  unrelated category, researchers studied individual’s decisions to enroll
  in 401(k) retirement plans administered by Hewitt Associates and found
  that if the choice was presented in a streamlined fashion (i.e., whether
  or not to enroll into a default plan), participation in the program
  increased dramatically.</p>
<p><strong>Help individuals understand their own preferences and
  tradeoffs.</strong> Perhaps the single fundamental reason for choice
  complexity has to do with the fact that most humans are limited
  cognitive processers of information. Technology and the internet provide
  one set of solutions: the development of web-based intelligent software
  applications that can help online shoppers find products and services
  that best fit their needs. shopping agents or shopping bots allow
  individuals to specify their needs and preferences at the level of an
  attribute, and then develop models of the buyer which are applied to
  available options in the marketplace to make recommendations.</p>
<p><strong>Organize and eliminate options.</strong> Rather than
  presenting all options in a complex choice set simultaneously, they
  could be categorized into different groups, and some of these groups
  could be eliminated sequentially as a function of the individual’s
  stated preference until the choice set is narrowed down to a manageable
  number. For instance, rather than presenting a prospective new home
  buyer with a listing of 200 available houses, a real estate agent might
  group them by location, age, proximity to the subway and school
  district.</p>
<p><strong>Encouraging attribute based decision-making.</strong> A close
  look at the typical Chinese take-out menu shows that most of the very
  large number of options available can be generated by considering
  permutations of a number of simple attributes. These may include the
  protein being cooked (beef, chicken, pork or tofu), the style of cooking
  (stir fried, boiled, grilled), the type of sauce used (sweet and sour,
  chilli, nut) and the type of noodles or rice requested (white rice,
  fried rice, vermicelli).</p>
<p><strong>Outsource choice.</strong> Perhaps the simplest form of
  outsourcing choice is to choose a recommended or default option. In this
  case, an individual relies on the presumed expertise of the
  recommendation provider and essentially allows this expert to make
  choices for them. A more active form of choice happens, for example,
  when an individual approaches a wealth manager and tasks them to manage
  their investment portfolio and make suitable buy / hold / sell decision.
  Alternately, a patient deferring to the opinion of a doctor on a
  treatment plan is another example of an outsourced choice.</p>
