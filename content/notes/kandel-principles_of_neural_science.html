      seven main parts.</p>
    <p><strong>B</strong>. The four lobes of the cerebral cortex.</p>

</figure>
<p>The spinal cord continues rostrally as the <strong>brain
  stem</strong> , which consists of the medulla oblongata, pons, and
  midbrain. The brain stem receives sensory information from the skin and
  muscles of the head and provides the motor control for the head’s
  musculature. It also conveys information from the spinal cord to the
  brain and from the brain to the spinal cord, and regulates levels of
  arousal and awareness through the reticular formation.</p>
<p>The brain stem contains several collections of cell bodies, the
  cranial nerve nuclei. Some of these nuclei receive information from the
  skin and muscles of the head; others control motor output to muscles of
  the face, neck, and eyes. Still others are specialized to process
  information from three of the special senses: hearing, balance, and
  taste.</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>medulla oblongata,</strong> directly rostral to the
    spinal cord, includes several centers responsible for vital autonomic
    functions, such as digestion, breathing, and the control of heart
    rate.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>pons,</strong> rostral to the medulla, conveys
    information about movement from the cerebral hemispheres to the
    cerebellum.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>cerebellum</strong> lies behind the pons and is
    connected to the brain stem by several major fiber tracts called
    <em>peduncles</em>. The cerebellum modulates the force and range of
    movement and is involved in the learning of motor skills.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>midbrain,</strong> rostral to the pons, controls many
    sensory and motor functions, including eye movement and the coordination
    of visual and auditory reflexes.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>diencephalon</strong> lies rostral to the midbrain and
    contains two structures. The <em>thalamus</em> processes most of the
    information reaching the cerebral cortex from the rest of the central
    nervous system. The <em>hypothalamus</em> regulates autonomic,
    endocrine, and visceral functions.
  </li>
  <li>The <strong>cerebrum</strong> comprises two cerebral hemispheres,
    each consisting of a heavily wrinkled outer layer (the <em>cerebral
      cortex</em>) and three deep-lying structures (the <em>basal
      ganglia</em>, the <em>hippocampus</em>, and the <em>amygdaloid
      nuclei</em>). The cerebral cortex is divided into four distinct lobes:
    frontal, parietal, occipital, and temporal.
  </li>
  <li>The basal ganglia participate in regulating motor performance; the
    hippocampus is involved with aspects of memory storage; and the
    amygdaloid nuclei coordinate the autonomic and endocrine responses of
    emotional states.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>The brain is also commonly divided into three broader regions: the
  <em>hindbrain</em> (medulla oblongata, pons, and cerebellum),
  <em>midbrain</em>, and <em>forebrain</em> (diencephalon and cerebrum).
  The hindbrain (excluding the cerebellum) and midbrain together include
  the same structures as the brain stem.</p>

<h3>Looking,

</figure>
<p>Initially almost everything known about the anatomical organization
  of language came from studies of patients with brain lesions. Today
  positron emission tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance
  imaging (fMRI) allow anatomical analysis to be conducted on healthy
  people engaged in reading, speaking, and thinking (Chapter 20).</p>
<p>Functional MRI, a noninvasive imaging technique for visualizing
  activity in the brain, has not only confirmed that reading and speaking
  activate different brain areas but has also revealed that
  <mark class="highlight1">the act of <i>thinking</i> about a
    word’s meaning in the absence of sensory inputs activates a still
    different area in the left frontal cortex.
  </mark>
</p>
<h3>Early and late bilingual</h3>
<p>These bilingual subjects were either “early” or “late” bilingual
  speakers; “early” bilinguals had learned two languages together prior to
  the age of 7 years, whereas “late” bilinguals acquired a second language
  after age 11 years. Axial slices of brain that intersect Broca’s area
  are shown for one representative “early” bilingual subject and one
  representative “late” bilingual subject.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Regions of the brain that responded during the narrative tasks are
    shown in <strong>red</strong> (native language) and
    <strong>yellow</strong> (native and second languages).
  </li>
  <li>In high-resolution views of these areas centroids of activity
    associated with each language are indicated by (+) and areas of overlap
    between the two areas are shown in <strong>orange</strong>. (Reproduced,
    with permission, from Kim et al.1997.)
  </li>
</ul>
<p>Hirsch and her colleagues made the interesting discovery that
  processing of one’s native language and processing of a second language
  occur in distinct regions within Broca’s area.</p>
<ul>
  <li>If the second language is acquired in adulthood, it is represented
    in a region separate from that which represents the native
    language.
  </li>
  <li>If the second language is acquired early, however, both the native
    language and the second language are represented in a common region in
    Broca’s area.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>These studies indicate
  <mark class="highlight1">that the
    age at which a language is acquired is a significant factor in
    determining the functional organization of Broca’s area
  </mark>
  . In
  contrast, there is no evidence of such separate processing of different
  languages in Wernicke’s area
</p>
<p>Chomsky argued that all natural languages share a common design,
  which he called <em>universal grammar</em>. The existence of universal
  grammar, he argued, implies that there is an innate system in the human
  brain that evolved to mediate this grammatical design of language. This,
  of course, raised the question: Where in the brain does such a system
  reside? Is it in Broca’s area, as Wernicke’s model would suggest?</p>
<p>Musso, Moro, and their colleagues asked this question and found that
  the region of Broca’s area concerned with second language becomes
  established and increases in activity only when an individual
  <mark class="highlight1">learns a second language that is
    “natural,” that is, one that shares the universal grammar.
  </mark>
  If the
  second language is an <em>artificial language</em>, a language that
  violates the rules of universal grammar, activity in Broca’s area does
  not increase. Thus Broca’s area must contain some kind of constraints
  that determine the structure of all natural languages.
</p>
<h3>Affective
  States Are Also Mediated by Local, Specialized Systems in the Brain</h3>
<p>Thus some neurons needed for language also exist in the right
  hemisphere. Indeed, there is now considerable evidence that an intact
  <mark class="highlight1">right hemisphere is necessary to
    appreciate semantic subtleties of language, such as irony, metaphor, and
    wit, as well as the emotional content of speech.
  </mark>
  There is also
  preliminary evidence that the ability to enjoy and perform music
  involves systems in the right hemisphere.
</p>
<p>Studies of patients with chronic temporal lobe epilepsy provide
  further clues to the areas in the brain that regulate affective states.
  These patients manifest characteristic emotional changes, some of which
  occur only fleetingly during the seizure itself (the so-called <em>ictal
    phenomena</em>). Common ictal phenomena include feelings of unreality;
  déjà vu, the sensation of having been in a place before or of having had
  a particular experience before; transient visual or auditory
  hallucinations; feelings of depersonalization, fear, or anger;
  delusions; inappropriate sexual feelings; and paranoia.</p>
<p>More enduring emotional changes, however, are evident when patients
  are not having seizures. These <em>interictal phenomena</em> are
  interesting because they resemble a coherent psychiatric syndrome. Such
  patients lose all interest in sex, and the decline in sexual interest is
  often paralleled by an increase in social aggressiveness. Most have one
  or more distinctive personality traits; they can be intensely emotional,
  ardently religious, extremely moralistic, or totally lacking in humor.
  In striking contrast, patients with epileptic foci outside the temporal
  lobe typically show no abnormal emotion and behavior.</p>
<p>Recent studies have found that high-frequency electrical stimulation
  of the subthalamic nucleus, part of the motor system, can markedly
  improve the tremor characteristic of Parkinson disease, a movement
  disorder we consider in Chapter 41. Alim-Louis Benabid and his
  colleagues have found that stimulation of this region also induces
  unusual emotional states including euphoria, increased libido, feelings
  of merriment, infectious laughter, and hilarity—aspects of emotional
  expression that are depressed in Parkinson disease. One patient who
  previously was depressed and had suicidal thoughts began to enjoy
  himself again and abandoned his thoughts about suicide. He became
  creative once again, began a number of different projects, bought
  himself a new sports car, and began flirting with women.</p>
<h3>Modular organization of
  brain</h3>
<p>In the aftermath of Wernicke’s discovery of the modular organization
  of language in the brain—interconnected serial and parallel processing
  centers with more-or-less independent functions—we now think that all
  cognitive abilities result from the interaction of many processing
  mechanisms distributed in several regions of the brain.
  <mark class="highlight2">Specific brain regions are not
    responsible for specific mental faculties but instead are <i>elementary
      processing units</i>.
  </mark>
</p>
<p>
  <mark class="highlight1">Perception, movement, language,
    thought, and memory are all made possible by the interlinkage of serial
    and parallel processing in discrete brain regions, each with specific
    functions.
  </mark>
  <mark class="highlight4">As a result,
    damage to a single area need not result in the complete loss of a
    cognitive function (or faculty) as many earlier neurologists believed.
    Even if a behavior initially disappears, it may partially return as
    undamaged parts of the brain reorganize their linkages.
  </mark>
</p>
<p>Thus it is not accurate to think of a mental process as being
  mediated by a chain of nerve cells connected in series—one cell
  connected directly to the next—for in such an arrangement the entire
  process breaks down when a single connection is disrupted. A more
  realistic metaphor is that of a process consisting of several parallel
  pathways in a communications network that can interact and ultimately
  converge upon a common set of target cells. The malfunction of a single
  pathway affects the information carried by it but need not disrupt the
  entire system. The remaining parts of the system can modify their
  performance to accommodate the breakdown of one pathway.</p>
<h3>How knowledge is stored in
  brain</h3>
<p>Our experience, however, is not a faithful guide to how knowledge is
  stored in memory. Knowledge about grandmother is not stored as a single
  representation but rather is subdivided into distinct categories and
  stored separately.</p>
<ul>
  <li>One region of the brain stores information about the invariant
    physical features that trigger your visual recognition of her.
  </li>
  <li>Information about changeable aspects of her face—her expression and
    lip movements that relate to social communication—is stored in another
    region.
  </li>
  <li>The ability to recognize her voice is mediated in yet another
    region.
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  <mark class="highlight4">The most astonishing example of
    the modular organization of mental processes is the finding that our
    very sense of self—a self-aware coherent being, the sum of what we mean
    when we say “I”—is achieved through the connection of independent
    circuits in our two cerebral hemispheres, each mediating its own sense
    of awareness. The remarkable discovery that even consciousness is not a
    unitary process was made by Roger Sperry, Michael Gazzaniga, and Joseph
    Bogen in the course of studying patients in whom the corpus callosum—the
    major tract connecting the two cerebral hemispheres—was severed as a
    treatment for epilepsy. They found that each hemisphere had a
    consciousness that was able to function independently of the
    other.

<h2>Nerve Cells, Neural
  Circuitry, and Behavior</h2>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="neuroncell" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-neuroncell.jpg">
  <footer>
    <p>A typical neuron has four morphologically defined regions:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the cell body,</li>
      <li>dendrites,</li>
      <li>axon, and</li>
      <li>presynaptic terminals.</li>
    </ol>
  </footer>
</figure>
<p>As we shall see later, each region has a distinct role in generating
  signals and communicating with other nerve cells.</p>
<p>The branches of a single axon may form synapses with as many as 1,000
  postsynaptic neurons. The apical and basal dendrites together with the
  cell body are the input elements of the neuron, receiving signals from
  other neurons.</p>
<p>These electrical signals, called <strong>action potentials</strong>, are initiated at a specialized trigger region
  near the origin of the
  axon called the <em>initial segment</em> from which they propagate down
  the axon without failure or distortion at speeds of 1 to 100 m/s. The
  amplitude of an action potential traveling down the axon remains
  constant at 100 mV because the action potential is an all-or-none
  impulse that is regenerated at regular intervals along the axon.</p>
<p>
  <mark class="highlight1">To increase the speed by which
    action potentials are conducted, large axons are wrapped in an
    insulating sheath of a lipid substance,
    <strong><i>myelin</i></strong>.
  </mark>
  The sheath is interrupted at
  regular intervals by the <strong>nodes of Ranvier</strong> , uninsulated
  spots on the axon where the action potential is regenerated.
</p>
<p>Most presynaptic terminals end on the postsynaptic neuron’s
  dendrites; but the terminals may also terminate on the cell body or,
  less often, at the beginning or end of the axon of the receiving
  cell.</p>
<h3>Neuron principles</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The first of these has come to be known as the <strong>principle of
    dynamic polarization</strong>. It states that electrical signals within
    a nerve cell flow only in one direction: from the receiving sites of the
    neuron, usually the dendrites and cell body, to the trigger region at
    the axon. From there the action potential is propagated along the entire
    length of the axon to its terminals. In most neurons studied to date
    electrical signals in fact travel in one direction. Later in this
    chapter we describe the physiological basis of this principle.
  </li>
  <li>The other principle advanced by Ramón y Cajal is that of
    <strong>connectional specificity</strong> , which states that nerve
    cells do not connect randomly with one another in the formation of
    networks. Rather each cell makes specific connections—at particular
    contact points—with certain postsynaptic target cells but not with
    others. The principles of dynamic polarization and connectional
    specificity are the basis of the modern connectionist approach to
    studying the brain.
  </li>
</ul>
<h3>Types of neurons</h3>
<p>Neurons are thus classified into three large groups: unipolar,
  bipolar, and multipolar.</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="neurontypes1" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-neurontypes1.jpg">
</figure>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="neurontypes2" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-neurontypes2.jpg">
</figure>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Unipolar cells</strong> have a single process emanating from
    the cell. Different segments serve as receptive surfaces or releasing
    terminals. Unipolar cells are characteristic of the invertebrate nervous
    system.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Bipolar cells</strong> have two types of processes that are
    functionally specialized. The dendrite receives electrical signals and
    the axon transmits signals to other cells.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Pseudo-unipolar cells</strong> are variants of bipolar cells
    that carry somatosensory information to the spinal cord. During
    development the two processes of the embryonic bipolar cell fuse and
    emerge from the cell body as a single process that has two functionally
    distinct segments. Both segments function as axons; one extends to
    peripheral skin or muscle, the other to the central spinal cord.
    (Adapted, with permission, from Ramón y Cajal 1933.)
  </li>
  <li><strong>Multipolar cells</strong> have a single axon and many
    dendrites. They are the most common type of neuron in the mammalian
    nervous system. Three examples illustrate the large diversity of these
    cells. Spinal motor neurons innervate skeletal muscle fibers. Pyramidal
    cells have a roughly triangular cell body; dendrites emerge from both
    the apex (the apical dendrite) and the base (the basal dendrites).
    Pyramidal cells are found in the hippocampus and throughout the cerebral
    cortex. Purkinje cells of the cerebellum are characterized by a rich and
    extensive dendritic tree that accommodates an enormous synaptic input.
    (Adapted, with permission, from Ramón y Cajal 1933.)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>A spinal motor neuron with a relatively modest number of dendrites
  receives about 10,000 contacts—1,000 on the cell body and 9,000 on
  dendrites. The dendritic tree of a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum is
  much larger and bushier, receiving as many as a million contacts!</p>
<h3>Nerve cells functional
  categories</h3>
<p>Nerve cells are also classified into three major functional
  categories:</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Sensory neurons</strong> carry information from the body’s
    peripheral sensors into the nervous system for the purpose of both
    perception and motor coordination.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Some primary sensory neurons are called afferent neurons, and the two
  terms are used interchangeably. The term afferent (carried toward the
  central nervous system) applies to all information reaching the central
  nervous system from the periphery, whether or not this information leads
  to sensation. The term sensory should, strictly speaking, be applied
  only to afferent inputs that lead to perception.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Motor neurons</strong> carry commands from the brain or
    spinal cord to muscles and glands (efferent information).
  </li>
  <li><strong>Interneurons</strong> are the most numerous and are
    subdivided into two classes: relay and local. Relay or projection
    interneurons have long axons and convey signals over considerable
    distances, from one brain region to another. Local interneurons have
    short axons because they form connections with nearby neurons in local
    circuits.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Glial cells</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="glialcell" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-glialcell.jpg">
</figure>
<p>There are many kinds of glial cells. As we will discuss in Chapter 4,
  the diversity in morphology of glial cells suggests that glia are
  probably as heterogeneous as neurons. Nonetheless, glia in the
  vertebrate nervous system can be divided into two major classes:
  microglia and macroglia.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Microglia</strong> are immune system cells that are
    mobilized to present antigens and become phagocytes during injury,
    infection, or degenerative diseases.
  </li>
  <li>There are three main types of <strong>macroglia</strong> :
    oligodendrocytes, Schwann cells, and astrocytes. In the human brain
    about 80% of all the cells are macroglia. Of these, approximately half
    are oligodendrocytes and half are astrocytes
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Oligodendrocytes</strong> are found in the central nervous
  system; each cell envelops from one to 30 axonal segments (called
  internodes), depending on axon diameter.</p>
<p><strong>Schwann cell</strong> s occur in the peripheral nervous
  system, where each envelops a single segment of one axon.</p>
<p>Upon myelination, oligodendrocytes and Schwann cells influence axons
  by enhancing signal conduction and by segregating voltage-sensitive ion
  channels into distinct axonal domains (called node of Ranvier).</p>
<p><strong>Astrocytes</strong> , the third main class of glial cells,
  owe their name to their irregular, roughly star-shaped cell bodies and
  large numbers of processes</p>
<p>They comprise two major types.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Protoplasmic astrocytes are found in the gray matter; their many
    processes end in sheet-like appendages.
  </li>
  <li>Fibrous astrocytes are found in the white matter and have long, fine
    processes that contain large bundles of tightly packed intermediate
    filaments. Both types of astrocytes have end-feet, dilatations that
    contact and surround capillaries and arterioles throughout the
    brain
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The functions of astrocytes are still mysterious. It is generally
  thought that astrocytes are not essential for information processing but
  support neurons in four ways:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Astrocytes separate cells, thereby insulating neuronal groups and
    synaptic connections from each other.
  </li>
  <li>Because astrocytes are highly permeable to K+, they help regulate
    the K+ concentration in the space between neurons. As we shall learn
    below, K+ flows out of neurons when they fire. Repetitive firing may
    create excess extracellular K+ that could interfere with signaling
    between cells in the vicinity.
    <mark class="highlight1">Astrocytes can take up the excess
      K+, and thus maintain the efficiency of signaling between
      neurons.
    </mark>
  </li>
  <li>Astrocytes perform other important housekeeping chores that promote
    efficient signaling between neurons. For example, as we shall learn
    later,
    <mark class="highlight1">they take up
      neurotransmitters from synaptic zones after release.
    </mark>
  </li>
  <li>Astrocytes help nourish surrounding neurons by releasing growth
    factors.
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Divergence and convergence</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="divergence" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-divergence.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Every behavior is mediated by specific sets of interconnected
  neurons, and every neuron’s behavioral function is determined by its
  connections with other neurons.</p>
<p>The stretching of just one muscle, the quadriceps, activates several
  hundred sensory neurons, each of which makes direct contact with 45 to
  50 motor neurons. This pattern of connection, in which one neuron
  activates many target cells, is called <strong>divergence</strong>.
  It is especially common in the input stages of the nervous system; by
  distributing its signals to many target cells, a single neuron can exert
  wide and diverse influence.</p>
<p>Conversely, a single motor cell in the knee jerk circuit receives 200
  to 450 input contacts from approximately 130 sensory cells. This pattern
  of connection is called <strong>convergence</strong>. It is common
  at the output stages of the nervous system; a target motor cell that
  receives information from many sensory neurons is able to integrate
  information from many sources. Convergence also ensures that a motor
  neuron is activated only if a sufficient number of sensory neurons
  become activated together.</p>
<h3>Feedforward and feeback
  inhibition</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="feedforwardinhibition" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-feedforwardinhibition.jpg">
</figure>
<p>This feature of the circuit is an example of <strong><em>feed-forward
  inhibition</em></strong> . In the knee-jerk reflex, feed-forward
  inhibition is <em>reciprocal</em>, ensuring that the flexor and extensor
  pathways always inhibit each other so that only muscles appropriate for
  the movement and not those opposed to it are recruited.</p>
<p>Neurons can also have connections that provide <strong>feedback
  inhibition</strong>. For example, a motor neuron may have excitatory
  connections with both a muscle and an inhibitory interneuron that in
  turn inhibits the motor neuron. The inhibitory interneuron is thus able
  to limit the ability of the motor neuron to excite the muscle.</p>
<h3>Four functional regions</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="neuronregions" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-neuronregions.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Most neurons, regardless of type, have four functional regions in
  which different types of signals are generated.</p>
<h3>Resting membrane potential</h3>
<p>Every cell, including a neuron, maintains a certain difference in the
  electrical potential on either side of the plasma membrane when the cell
  is at rest. This is called the <strong>resting membrane
    potential</strong>.</p>
<p>In a typical resting neuron the voltage of the inside of the cell is
  about 65 mV more negative than the voltage outside the cell. Because the
  voltage outside the membrane is defined as zero, we say the resting
  membrane potential is –65 mV. The resting potential in different nerve
  cells ranges from –40 to –80 mV; in muscle cells it is greater still,
  about –90 mV.</p>
<p>A reduction in membrane potential is called
  <strong>depolarization</strong> <em>. Because depolarization enhances a
    cell’s ability to generate an action potential, it is excitatory. In
    contrast, an increase in membrane potential is called </em>
  <strong>hyperpolarization</strong>. Hyperpolarization makes a cell
  less likely to generate an action potential and is therefore
  inhibitory.</p>
<h3>Receptor potential</h3>
<p>In sensory neurons current flow is typically initiated by a physical
  stimulus, which activates specialized receptor proteins at the neuron’s
  receptive surface. In our example of the knee-jerk reflex, stretching of
  the muscle activates specific ion channels that open in response to
  stretch of the sensory neuron membrane. The opening of these channels
  when the cell is stretched permits the rapid influx of Na+ ions into the
  sensory cell. This ionic current changes the membrane potential,
  producing a local signal called the <strong><em>receptor
    potential</em></strong>.</p>
<p>The amplitude and duration of a receptor potential depend on the
  intensity of the muscle stretch: The larger or longer-lasting the
  stretch, the larger or longer-lasting the resulting receptor potential.
  Thus, unlike the action potential, which is all or none, receptor
  potentials are graded. Most receptor potentials are depolarizing
  (excitatory). However, hyperpolarizing (inhibitory) receptor potentials
  are found in the retina.</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="inputsignals" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-inputsignals.jpg">
</figure>
<ol>
  <li>The input signal, called a receptor potential, is graded in
    amplitude and duration, proportional to the amplitude and duration of
    the stimulus.
  </li>
  <li>The trigger zone
    <mark class="highlight1">sums</mark>
    the depolarization generated by the receptor potential.
    <mark class="highlight1">An action potential is generated
      only if the receptor potential exceeds a certain voltage
      threshold.
    </mark>
    Once this threshold is surpassed, any further increase
    in amplitude of the receptor potential can only increase the frequency
    with which the action potentials are generated, because action
    potentials have a constant amplitude. The duration of the receptor
    potential determines the duration of the train of action potentials.
    Thus the graded amplitude and duration of the receptor potential is
    translated into a frequency code in the action potentials generated at
    the trigger zone. All action potentials produced are propagated
    faithfully along the axon.
  </li>
  <li>Action potentials are all-or-none. Because all action potentials
    have a similar amplitude and duration, the frequency and duration of
    firing represents the information carried by the signal.
  </li>
  <li>When the action potential reaches the synaptic terminal, it
    initiates the release of a neurotransmitter, the chemical substance that
    serves as the output signal.
    <mark class="highlight1">The
      frequency of action potentials determines exactly how much
      neurotransmitter is released by the cell.
    </mark>
  </li>
</ol>
<h3>Synaptic potential</h3>
<p>Like the receptor potential, the synaptic potential is graded; its
  amplitude depends on how much transmitter is released. In the same cell
  the synaptic potential can be either depolarizing or hyperpolarizing
  depending on the type of receptor molecule that is activated. Synaptic
  potentials, like receptor potentials, spread passively and thus are
  local changes in potential unless the signal reaches beyond the axon’s
  initial segment and thus can give rise to an action potential.</p>
<h3>The
  Trigger Zone Makes the Decision to Generate an Action Potential</h3>
<p>Sherrington first pointed out that the function of the nervous system
  is to weigh the consequences of different types of information and then
  decide on appropriate responses. This <em>integrative</em> function of
  the nervous system is clearly seen in the actions of the trigger zone of
  the neuron, the initial segment of the axon.</p>
<p>Action potentials are generated by a sudden influx of Na+ through
  channels in the cell membrane that open and close in response to changes
  in membrane potential. When an input signal (a receptor potential or
  synaptic potential) depolarizes an area of membrane, the local change in
  membrane potential opens local Na+ channels that allow Na+ to flow down
  its concentration gradient, from outside the cell where the Na+
  concentration is high to inside where it is low.</p>
<p>
  <mark class="highlight1">Because the initial segment of
    the axon has the highest density of voltage-sensitive Na+ channels and
    therefore the lowest threshold for generating an action
    potential
  </mark>
  , an input signal spreading passively along the cell
  membrane is more likely to give rise to an action potential at the
  initial segment than at other sites in the cell. This part of the axon
  is therefore known as the <strong><em>trigger zone</em></strong> . It is
  here that the activity of all receptor (or synaptic) potentials is
  <mark class="highlight1">summed</mark>
  and where, if the sum
  of the input signals reaches threshold, the neuron generates an action
  potential.
</p>
<p>In addition, unlike receptor and synaptic potentials, which spread
  passively and decrease in amplitude,
  <mark class="highlight1">the action potential does not
    decay
  </mark>
  as it travels along the axon to its target—a distance that
  can be as great as 2 m—because it is periodically regenerated.
  <mark class="highlight2">This conducting signal can travel
    at rates as fast as 100 m/s.
  </mark>
</p>
<h3>Patterns of action
  potentials</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="actionpotentialpatterns1"
       src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-actionpotentialpatterns1.jpg">
  <img alt="actionpotentialpatterns2"
       src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-actionpotentialpatterns2.jpg">
</figure>
<p>In addition to the frequency of the action potentials, the pattern of
  action potentials also conveys important information. For example, some
  neurons are not silent in the absence of stimulation but are
  spontaneously active.</p>
<p>Some spontaneously active nerve cells (beating neurons) fire action
  potentials regularly; other neurons (bursting neurons) fire in brief
  bursts of action potentials. These diverse cells respond differently to
  the same excitatory synaptic input. An excitatory synaptic potential may
  initiate one or more action potentials in a cell that does not have a
  spontaneous activity, but in spontaneously active cells that same input
  will modulate the rhythm by increasing the rate of firing of action
  potentials.</p>
<p>Inhibitory inputs have little information value in a silent cell. By
  contrast, in spontaneously active cells inhibition can have a powerful
  <em>sculpting</em> role. By establishing periods of silence in otherwise
  ongoing activity, inhibition can produce a complex pattern of
  alternating firing and silence where none existed.</p>
<p>If signals are stereotyped and reflect only the most elementary
  properties of the stimulus, how can they carry the rich variety of
  information needed for complex behavior? How is a message that carries
  visual information about a bee distinguished from one that carries pain
  information about the bee’s sting, and how are these sensory signals
  distinguished from motor signals for voluntary movement?</p>
<p>The answer is simple and yet is one of the most important
  organizational principles of the nervous system: Pathways of connected
  neurons, not individual neurons, convey information.
  <mark class="highlight1">Interconnected neurons form
    anatomically and functionally distinct pathways.
  </mark>
  The neural
  pathways activated by receptor cells in the retina that respond to light
  are completely distinct from the pathways activated by sensory cells in
  the skin that respond to touch.
</p>
<h3>The release of the
  neurotransmitter</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="musclesignals" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-musclesignals.jpg">
</figure>
<p>To eject their transmitter substance into the synaptic cleft, the
  vesicles move up to and fuse with the neuron’s plasma membrane, then
  burst open, a process known as <em>exocytosis</em>.</p>
<p>Once released, the neurotransmitter is the neuron’s output signal.
  Like the input signal, it is graded. The amount of transmitter released
  is determined by the number and frequency of the action potentials that
  reach the presynaptic terminals. After release the transmitter diffuses
  across the synaptic cleft and binds to receptors on the postsynaptic
  neuron. This binding causes the postsynaptic cell to generate a synaptic
  potential.
  <mark class="highlight1">Whether the synaptic
    potential has an excitatory or inhibitory effect depends on the type of
    receptor in the postsynaptic cell, not on the particular chemical
    neurotransmitter.
  </mark>
  The same transmitter substance can have
  different effects at different receptors.
</p>
<h3>The
  Transformation of the Neural Signal from Sensory to Motor</h3>
<p>The more the receptor potential exceeds threshold, the greater the
  depolarization and consequently the greater the frequency of action
  potentials in the axon.</p>
<p>The neurotransmitter binds receptors on the muscle fiber, triggering
  a synaptic potential in the muscle. If sufficiently large, or if
  combined with signals from other motor neurons, the synaptic potential
  will generate an action potential in the muscle, causing contraction of
  the muscle fiber.</p>
<h3>Some neurons do
  not generate action potentials</h3>
<p>These are typically local interneurons without a conductive
  component; they have no axon or such a short one that regeneration of
  the signal is not required. In
  <mark class="highlight1">these neurons the input signals are
    summed and spread passively to the pre-synaptic terminal region nearby
    where transmitter is released.
  </mark>
  Neurons that are spontaneously
  active do not require sensory or synaptic inputs to fire action
  potentials because they have a special class of ion channels that permit
  Na+ current flow even in the absence of excitatory synaptic input.
</p>
<p>because the nervous system has so many cell types and variations at
  the molecular level, it is susceptible to more diseases (psychiatric as
  well as neurological) than any other organ system of the body.</p>
<h3>Parallel processing and
  neural networks</h3>
<p>Moreover, each component may have multiple neural pathways that
  simultaneously provide the same or similar information. The deployment
  of several neuronal groups or pathways to convey similar information is
  called <em>parallel processing</em>. <strong>Parallel
    processing</strong> also occurs in a single pathway when different
  neurons in the pathway perform similar computations simultaneously.
  Parallel processing makes enormous sense as an evolutionary strategy for
  building a more powerful brain, for it increases both the speed and
  reliability of function within the central nervous system.</p>
<p>Many theoretical neurobiologists have turned to different types of
  models that include parallel processing, which they call <em>neural
    networks</em>. In these models, elements of the system process
  information simultaneously using both feed-forward and feedback
  connections. Interestingly,
  <mark class="highlight1">in
    systems with feedback circuits it is the dynamic activity of the system
    that determines the outcome of computation, not inputs or initial
    conditions.
  </mark>
</p>
<p>Neural network models capture well the highly recurrent architecture
  of most actual neural circuits and also
  <mark class="highlight1">the ability of the brain to
    function in the absence of specific sensory input from outside the body
    such as during thinking, sleep, and the generation of endogenous
    rhythms
  </mark>
  , something with which traditional deterministic models
  have difficulty. Neural network models also show that analysis of
  individual elements of a system may not be enough to decode the
  <em>action potential code</em>. According to this neural network view,
  <mark class="highlight4">what makes the brain a remarkable
    information processing organ is not the complexity of its neurons but
    the fact that it has many elements interconnected in a variety of
    complex ways.
  </mark>
</p>
<h2>Genes and Behavior</h2>
<p>Heritability for human diseases and behavioral traits is usually
  substantially less than 100%, demonstrating that the environment is an
  important factor in acquiring diseases or traits. Estimates of
  heritability for many neurological, psychiatric, and behavioral traits
  from twin studies range around 50%, but heritability can be higher or
  lower for particular traits (Figure 3–1B). Although studies of identical
  twins and other kinships provide support for the idea that human
  behavior has a hereditary component, they do not tell us which genes are
  important, let alone how specific genes affect behavior. These questions
  can be addressed more easily by genetic studies in experimental animals
  in which both the gene and the environment are strictly controlled.</p>
<h3>The Nature of the Gene</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="adn" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-adn.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Genes are made of DNA, and it is DNA that is passed on from one
  generation to the next. Through DNA replication exact copies of each
  gene are provided to all cells in an organism as well as to succeeding
  generations. DNA is made of two strands, each of which has a
  deoxyribose-phosphate backbone attached to a series of four subunits:
  the nucleotides adenine (A), guanine (G), thymine (T), and cytosine (C).
  The two strands are paired so that an A on one strand is always paired
  with a T on the complementary strand, and a G with a C.</p>
<p>Most genes encode protein products, which are generated by
  translation of the linear messenger RNA (mRNA) sequence into a linear
  polypeptide (protein) sequence composed of 20 different amino acids. A
  typical gene consists of a coding region, which is translated into a
  protein, and noncoding regions (Figure 3–3). The coding region is
  usually broken into small segments called exons that are separated by
  noncoding stretches called introns. The introns are deleted from the
  mRNA before its translation into protein.</p>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="genestructure" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-genestructure.jpg">
</figure>
<ol>
  <li>A gene consists of coding regions (exons) separated by noncoding
    regions (introns). Its transcription is regulated by noncoding regions
    such as promoters and enhancers that are frequently found near the
    beginning of the gene.
  </li>
  <li>Transcription leads to production of a primary single-stranded RNA
    transcript that includes both exons and introns.
  </li>
  <li>Splicing removes introns from the immature transcript and ligates
    the exons into a mature messenger RNA (mRNA), which is exported from the
    nucleus of the cell.
  </li>
  <li>The mature mRNA is translated into a protein product.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each cell in the body contains the DNA for every gene but only
  expresses a specific subset of the genes as RNAs. The part of the gene
  that is transcribed into RNA is flanked by noncoding DNA regions, called
  <em>promoters</em> and <em>enhancers</em>, that allow accurate
  expression of the RNA in the right cells at the right time. Promoters
  and enhancers are typically found close to the beginning of the region
  to be transcribed, but can also act at a distance. A unique complement
  of DNA-binding proteins within each cell interacts with promoters and
  enhancers to regulate gene expression and resulting cellular
  properties.</p>
<h3>Genes Are Arranged on
  Chromosomes</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="chromosomes" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-chromosomes.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Humans have about 25,000 genes but only 46 chromosomes: 22 pairs of
  autosomes (chromosomes that are present in both males and females) and 2
  sex chromosomes (2 X chromosomes in females, 1 X and 1 Y chromosome in
  males).</p>
<p>In addition to the genes on chromosomes, a very small number of an
  organism’s genes are transmitted through cytoplasmic organelles called
  <em>mitochondria</em>, which carry out metabolic processes. Mitochondria
  in all children come from the ovum and therefore are transmitted from
  the mother to the child. Certain human disorders, including some
  neuromuscular degenerative diseases, mental retardation, and some forms
  of deafness, are caused by mutations in the mitochondrial DNA.</p>
<h3>The
  Relationship Between Genotype and Phenotype</h3>
<p>The two copies of a particular autosomal gene in an individual are
  called <strong>alleles</strong>. If the two alleles are identical,
  the individual is said to be <em>homozygous</em> at that locus. If the
  alleles vary because of mutations, the individual is
  <em>heterozygous</em> at that locus. Males are <em>hemizygous</em> for
  genes on the X chromosome. A population can have a large number of
  alleles of a gene; for example, a single gene that affects human eye
  color called OCA2 can have alleles that encode shades of blue, green,
  hazel, or brown.</p>
<p>Genes and proteins are resilient in the face of small changes, so not
  every sequence change in a gene is deleterious. Most mutations are
  simply allelic polymorphisms that are silent; that is, they do not have
  any effect on the phenotype. Some are not silent but are expressed in
  ways that are benign, for example in eye color. Only rare mutations
  cause disturbance in development, cell function, or overt behavior. Some
  mutations are pathogenic, however, and these lead to disease.</p>
<p>The rate of spontaneously occurring mutations is low but measurable;
  spontaneous mutations make a significant contribution to human genetic
  disease. The frequency of mutations greatly increases when the organism
  is exposed to chemical mutagens or ionizing radiation during
  experimental genetic studies.</p>
<p>Chemical mutagens tend to induce point mutations involving changes in
  a single DNA base pair or the deletion of a few base pairs. By contrast,
  ionizing radiation can induce large insertions, deletions, or
  translocations. Both spontaneous and induced mutations can lead to
  changes in the structure of the protein encoded by the gene or to a
  partial decrease or absence of gene expression.</p>
<p>Functional changes in a single base pair within a coding region can
  be of three kinds: (1) a missense mutation, where the point mutation
  results in one amino acid in a protein being substituted for another;
  (2) a nonsense mutation, where a codon (a triplet of nucleotides) within
  the coding region is replaced by a stop codon, resulting in a shortened
  (truncated) protein product; or (3) a frame-shift mutation, in which
  small insertions or deletions of nucleotides change the reading frame,
  leading to the production of a truncated or abnormal protein.</p>
<p>Large-scale mutations involve changes in chromosome structure that
  can affect the function of one gene or many contiguous genes. Such
  mutations include rearrangement of genes without the addition or
  deletion of material (inversion), or deletion or duplication of genes in
  a chromosome (copy number variation).</p>
<p>Although most singlegene traits are recessive, rearrangements that
  lead to duplication or deletion of multiple genes often have dominant
  effects.</p>
<h3>Genes Are Conserved
  Through Evolution</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="genessimilarity" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-genessimilarity.jpg">
</figure>
<p>the unique human species did not result from the invention of unique
  new human genes.</p>
<p>Humans and chimpanzees are profoundly different in their biology and
  behavior, yet they share 99% of their protein-coding genes. Moreover,
  most of the approximately 25,000 genes in humans are also present in
  other mammals like mice, and over half of all human genes are very
  similar to genes in invertebrates such as worms and flies (Figure 3–5).
  The conclusion from this surprising discovery is that ancient genes that
  humans share with other animals are regulated in new ways to produce
  novel human properties, like the capacity to generate complex thoughts
  and language.</p>
<p>Differences between mammalian genes and their invertebrate
  counterparts most often result from gene duplication in mammals or
  subtle changes in gene expression and function, rather than the creation
  of entirely new genes.</p>
<p>A group of genes, not one gene, are conserved regulators of the
  circadian clock.</p>
<h3>Altering Gene
  Function by RNA Interference</h3>
<p>To reduce the function of a gene by RNA interference, small-sequence
  RNA is introduced that will pair with the endogenous mRNA because of
  complementarity between the small RNA sequence and the desired mRNA.
  Small RNA is usually 21 or 22 bases in length, and is known as small
  interfering RNA (siRNA) or small hairpin RNA (shRNA).</p>
<p>Pairing of siRNA or shRNA with mRNA leads to destruction of the
  endogenous mRNA by ribonucleases within the cell. The siRNA can be
  introduced by direct transfection of RNA into cells, or transgenes can
  be introduced into cells that drive expression of siRNA or shRNA.</p>
<h3>Circadian
  Rhythm Is Generated by a Transcriptional Oscillator in Flies, Mice, and
  Humans</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="circadianrythm" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-circadianrythm.jpg">
</figure>
<p>The molecular properties of per, clock, and related genes generate
  all properties essential for circadian rhythm. The key elements of the
  regulatory process are:</p>
<ol>
  <li>The transcription of circadian rhythm genes varies with the 24-hour
    cycle: PER activity is high at night, CLOCK activity is high during the
    day.
  </li>
  <li>The circadian rhythm genes are transcription factors that affect
    each other’s mRNA level, generating the oscillations. CLOCK activates
    per transcription and PER represses CLOCK function.
  </li>
  <li>The circadian rhythm genes also control the transcription of output
    genes that affect many downstream responses. For example, in flies the
    neuropeptide gene pdf controls locomotor activity levels.
  </li>
  <li>The oscillation of these genes can be reset by light.</li>
</ol>
<p>Recent work has shown that the same genetic network controls
  circadian rhythm in humans. People with advanced sleep-phase syndrome
  have short 20-day cycles and an extreme early-to-bed, early-to-rise
  “morning lark” phenotype. Louis Ptáĉek and Ying-hui Fu found that these
  individuals have mutations in a human per gene. These results
  demonstrate that genes for behavior are conserved from insects to
  humans.</p>
<h3>The Role of Genes in
  Behavior</h3>
<p>Work by Marla Sokolowski and her colleagues led to the identification
  of the first gene associated with variation in behavior among normal
  individuals in a species.</p>
<p>Sokolowski used crosses between different wild flies to investigate
  the genetic differences between rover and sitter larvae. These crosses
  showed that the difference between rover and sitter larvae lies in a
  single major gene, the for (forager) locus. The for gene encodes a
  signal transduction enzyme, a protein kinase activated by the cellular
  metabolite cyclic guanosine 3′-5′monophosphate (cGMP). Thus this natural
  variation in behavior arises from altered regulation of signal
  transduction pathways. Many neuronal functions are regulated by protein
  kinases such as the cGMP-dependent kinase encoded by the for gene.
  Molecules such as protein kinases are particularly significant at
  transforming short-term neural signals into long-term changes in the
  property of a neuron or circuit.</p>
<p>Why would variability in signaling enzymes be preserved in wild
  populations of Drosophila, which typically include both rovers and
  sitters? The answer is that variations in the environment favor
  alternative genetic forms: There is balanced selection for both
  behaviors. Crowded environments favor the rover larva, which is more
  effective at moving to new, unexploited food sources in advance of
  competitors, whereas sparse environments favor the sitter larva, which
  exploits the current source more thoroughly.</p>
<p>The for gene also affects honeybee behavior. Honeybees exhibit
  different behaviors at different stages of their life; in general, young
  bees are nurses, while older bees become foragers that leave the hive.
  The for gene is expressed at high levels in the brains of active
  foraging honeybees, and at low levels in the younger and more stationary
  nurse bees. Activation of cGMP signaling in young bees can cause them to
  enter the forager stage prematurely.</p>
<p>Many aspects of behavior are associated with an animal’s social
  interactions with other animals. Social behaviors are highly variable
  between species, yet have a large innate component within a species that
  is controlled genetically.</p>
<p>The difference between social and solitary worms is caused by a
  single amino acid substitution in a single gene, a member of a large
  family of genes involved in signaling between neurons. This gene, npr-1,
  encodes a neuropeptide receptor. Neuropeptides have long been
  appreciated for their roles in coordinating behaviors across networks of
  neurons. For example, a neuropeptide hormone of the marine snail Aplysia
  stimulates a complex set of movements and behavior patterns associated
  with a single behavior, egg laying. Mammalian neuropeptides have been
  implicated in feeding behavior, sleep, pain, and many other behaviors
  and physiological processes. The existence of a mutation in the
  neuropeptide receptor that alters social behavior suggests that this
  kind of signaling molecule is important both for generating the behavior
  and for generating the variation between individuals.</p>
<p>
  <mark class="highlight1">Neuropeptide receptors have also
    been implicated in the regulation of mammalian social behavior. The
    neuropeptides oxytocin and vasopressin stimulate mammalian affiliative
    behaviors such as pair bonding and parental bonding with
    offspring.
  </mark>
  Oxytocin is required in mice for social recognition,
  the ability to identify a familiar individual. Oxytocin and vasopressin
  have been studied in depth in prairie voles, rodents that form lasting
  pairs to raise their young. Oxytocin released in the brain of female
  prairie voles during mating stimulates pair-bond formation. Likewise,
  vasopressin released in the brain of male prairie voles during mating
  stimulates pair-bond formation and paternal behavior.
</p>
<p>The importance of oxytocin and vasopressin and their receptors has
  been confirmed and extended by reverse genetic studies in mice, which
  are genetically easier to manipulate than voles. For example,
  introducing the V1a vasopressin receptor gene from prairie voles into
  male mice, which behave more like montane voles, increases the
  expression of the V1a vasopressin receptor in the ventral pallidum and
  increases the affiliative behavior of the male mice toward females. Thus
  differences between species in the pattern of expression of the
  vasopressin receptor can contribute to differences in social
  behaviors.</p>
<p>The analysis of vasopressin receptors in different rodents provides
  insight into the mechanisms by which genes and behaviors can change
  during evolution. Genetic changes in evolution alter the pattern of
  expression of the V1a vasopressin receptor in the ventral forebrain.
  These changes in turn alter the activity of a neural circuit, so that
  the function of the ventral forebrain is linked to the function of the
  vasopressin-secreting neurons that are activated by mating. As a result,
  social behaviors are altered.</p>
<h3>Genetic
  Studies of Human Behavior and Its Abnormalities</h3>
<p>The PKU phenotype (mental retardation) results from the interaction
  of the genotype (the homozygous <em>pku</em> mutation) and the
  environment (the diet). The treatment for PKU is thus simple and
  effective: Mental retardation can be prevented by a low-protein diet.
  The molecular and genetic analysis of gene function in PKU has led to
  dramatic improvements in the life of PKU patients. Since the early 1960s
  the United States has instated mandatory testing for PKU in newborns. By
  identifying children with the genetic disorder and modifying their diet
  before the disease appears many aspects of the disorder can be
  prevented.</p>
<p>Another rare syndrome has shed light on genetic requirements for
  human language. A study of a human family with defects in speech
  articulation, as well as grammatical and linguistic impairment, led to
  the identification of a specific mutation in the transcriptional
  regulator <em>FOXP2</em>. This gene is not uniquely human—it is present
  in all mammals and birds—but several changes in the gene have appeared
  since the divergence of humans and other primates.
  <mark class="highlight1">A human-specific pattern of
    development of the brain, larynx, or mouth under the control of
    <i>FOXP2</i> might be one of the genetic adaptations that made human
    speech possible.
  </mark>
</p>
<h3>Psychiatric
  Disorders and the Challenge of Understanding Multigenic Traits</h3>
<p>In humans a Disc1 mutation greatly increases the risk of
  schizophrenia, but it is mutated only in a small fraction of
  schizophrenic patients. Other candidate genes for schizophrenia have
  been identified from the alternative approach of looking for statistical
  associations between the disorder and specific loci in the genome in a
  sample of thousands of schizophrenic patients from different families.
  One risk gene identified in this way is neuregulin, a developmental
  signaling gene that affects cell migration and synapse formation.
  Together the studies of Disc1 and neuregulin begin to suggest that a
  developmental defect in the brain can underlie schizophrenia.</p>
<p>Similar large-scale studies of thousands of autistic children and
  their families have led to the repeated identification of mutations in
  certain autism risk genes. Several mutations in autistic patients affect
  transmembrane signaling proteins called neurexins and neuroligins, which
  affect the strength of synapses. These results and other genetic results
  suggest that subtle alterations in synaptic transmission play a role in
  autism. Sophisticated genetic analysis suggests that an increased risk
  for autism exists at many locations in the genome (Figure 3–17). Some of
  these loci may be rare monogenic high-risk variants and others may be
  more common, low-risk variants.</p>
<p>One remarkable discovery made by Michael Wigler’s group while trying
  to understand the genetic basis of autism is that a fraction of the
  mutations associated with autism are not actually inherited from either
  parent. They are new mutations in the autistic child that arose in the
  sperm or the oocyte prior to fertilization. Identical monozygotic twins
  that separate after fertilization will both have the trait, the
  classical definition of herit-ability. Moreover, once the mutation
  arises, the affected child has a trait that can be passed on to his or
  her children, so it is indeed a heritable trait. However, classical
  genetic linkage studies rely on the assumption that virtually all
  disease-causing mutations are preexisting mutations inherited across
  many generations, and the finding of new mutations in autism violate
  that expectation. Human biology is a constant source of surprises.</p>
<h3>An Overall View</h3>
<p>Yet it is the interplay of genetics, environment, chance, and
  individual choice that ultimately determines the behavioral differences
  between individuals. The challenge of genetics is to understand the
  undeniable effects of genes, while acknowledging that many factors
  influence human mental processes and behavior.</p>
<h1>Cell and Molecular
  Biology of the Neuron</h1>

  System</h2>
<h3>Neurons
  and Glia Share Many Structural and Molecular Characteristics</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="muscleneuron" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-muscleneuron.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Cytoplasm has two main components: cytosol and membranous
  organelles.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Cytosol is the aqueous phase of cytoplasm. In this phase only a few
    proteins are actually free in solution. With the exception of some
    enzymes that catalyze metabolic reactions, most proteins are organized
    into functional complexes.
  </li>
  <li>Membranous organelles, the second main component of cytoplasm,
    include mitochondria and peroxisomes as well as a complex system of
    tubules, vesicles, and cisternae called the <em>vacuolar apparatus</em>.
    Mitochondria and peroxisomes process molecular oxygen. Mitochondria
    generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP), the major molecule by which
    cellular energy is transferred or spent, whereas peroxisomes prevent
    accumulation of the strong oxidizing agent hydrogen peroxide.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>The vacuolar apparatus includes the rough endoplasmic reticulum, the
  smooth endoplasmic reticulum, the Golgi complex, secretory vesicles,
  endosomes, lysosomes, and a multiplicity of transport vesicles that
  interconnect these various compartments.</p>
<p>The major subcompartments of this system are anatomically
  discontinuous, but they remain functionally connected because membranous
  and lumenal material is moved from one compartment to another by means
  of transport vesicles. For example, proteins and phospholipids
  synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum (the portion of the
  reticulum nearest the nucleus and studded with ribosomes) and the smooth
  endoplasmic reticulum are transported to the Golgi complex and then to
  secretory vesicles, which empty their contents when the vesicle membrane
  fuses with the plasmalemma (a process called exocytosis). This secretory
  pathway serves to add membranous components to the plasmalemma and also
  to discharge any contents of the secretory vesicles into the
  extracellular space.</p>
<p>Conversely, plasmalemmal membrane is taken into the cell in the form
  of endocytic vesicles (endocytosis). These are incorporated into early
  endosomes, sorting compartments that are concentrated at the cell’s
  periphery. The incorporated membrane, which typically contains specific
  proteins such as receptors, is then either shuttled back to the
  plasmalemma by vesicles for recycling or directed to late endosomes and
  eventually to mature lysosomes for degradation.</p>
<p>A specialized portion of the rough endoplasmic reticulum forms the
  <strong>nuclear envelope</strong> , a spherical flattened cisterna that
  surrounds chromosomal DNA and its associated proteins (histones,
  transcription factors, polymerases, and isomerases) and defines the
  nucleus (Figure 4-1). Because the nuclear envelope is continuous with
  other portions of the endoplasmic reticulum and to the other membranes
  of the vacuolar apparatus, it is presumed to have evolved as an
  invagination of the plasmalemma to ensheathe eukaryotic chromosomes. The
  nuclear envelope is interrupted by nuclear pores, where fusion of the
  inner and outer membranes of the envelope results in the formation of
  hydrophilic channels through which proteins and RNA are exchanged
  between the cytoplasm proper and the nuclear cytoplasm.</p>
<h3>The Cytoskeleton
  Determines Cell Shape</h3>
<p>The cytoskeleton determines the shape of a cell and is responsible
  for the asymmetric distribution of organelles within the cytoplasm. It
  includes three filamentous structures: microtubules, neurofilaments, and
  microfilaments. These filaments and associated proteins account for
  approximately a quarter of the total protein in the cell.</p>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Microtubules</strong> form long scaffolds that extend from
    one end of a neuron to the other and play a key role in developing and
    maintaining cell shape.
  </li>
  <li><strong>Neurofilaments</strong> , 10 nm in diameter, are the bones
    of the cytoskeleton (see Figure 4-5B). They are the most abundant
    fibrillar component in axons; on average there are 3 to 10 times more
    neurofilaments than microtubules in an axon. Neurofilaments are related
    to intermediate filaments of other cell types, including the
    cytokeratins of epithelial cells (hair and nails), glial fibrillary
    acidic protein in astrocytes, and desmin in muscle. Unlike microtubules,
    neurofilaments are stable and almost totally polymerized in the
    cell.
  </li>
  <li>At 3-7 nm in diameter <strong>microfilaments</strong> are the
    thinnest of the three main types of fibers that make up the cytoskeleton
    (Figure 4-5C). Like thin filaments of muscle, microfilaments are made up
    of two strands of polymerized globular actin monomers, each bearing an
    ATP or adenosine diphosphate (ADP), wound into a double-stranded helix.
    Actin is a major constituent of all cells, perhaps the most abundant
    animal protein in nature. There are several closely related molecular
    forms: the α actin of skeletal muscle and at least two other molecular
    forms, β and γ. Each is encoded by a different gene. Neural actin in
    higher vertebrates is a mixture of the β and γ species, which differ
    from muscle actin by a few amino acid residues. Most actin molecules are
    highly conserved, not only in different cell types of a species but also
    in organisms as distantly related as humans and protozoa.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Unlike microtubules and neurofilaments, actin filaments are short.
  They are concentrated at the cell’s periphery in the cortical cytoplasm
  just underneath the plasmalemma, where they form a dense network with
  many actin-binding proteins (eg, spectrin-fodrin, ankyrin, talin, and
  actinin). This matrix plays a key role in the dynamic function of the
  cell’s periphery, such as the motility of growth cones (the growing tips
  of axons) during development, generation of specialized microdomains at
  the cell surface, and the formation of pre- and postsynaptic
  morphological specializations.</p>

  <mark class="highlight1">The dynamic state of
    microtubules and microfilaments permits a mature neuron to retract old
    axons and dendrites and extend new ones.
  </mark>
  This structural
  plasticity is thought to be a major factor in changes of synaptic
  connections and efficacy, and therefore cellular mechanisms of long-term
  memory and learning.
</p>
<p>In addition to serving as cytoskeleton, microtubules and actin
  filaments act as tracks along which organelles and proteins are rapidly
  driven by molecular motors. The motors used by the actin filaments, the
  myosins, also mediate other types of cell motility, including extension
  of the cell’s processes, and the translocation of membranous organelles
  from the bulk cytoplasm to the region adjacent to the plasma membrane.
  (Actomyosin is responsible for muscle contraction.) Because the
  microtubules and actin filaments are polar, each motor drives its
  organelle cargo in only one direction.</p>
<p>As already mentioned, microtubules are arranged in parallel in the
  axon with positive ends pointing away from the cell body and negative
  ends facing the cell body. This regular orientation permits some
  organelles to move toward nerve endings and others to move away from
  nerve endings, the direction being determined by the specific type of
  molecule motor, thus maintaining the distinctive distribution of axonal
  organelles.</p>
<h3>Abnormal
  Accumulations of Proteins Are Hallmarks of Many Neurological
  Disorders</h3>
<p>Tau is a microtubule-binding protein normally present in nerve cells.
  In Alzheimer disease abnormal aggregates of tau are visible in the light
  microscope in neurons and glia as well as in the extracellular
  space.</p>
<p>In normal neurons tau is either bound to microtubules or free in the
  cytosol. In the tangles it is not bound to microtubules but is highly
  insoluble. The tangles form at least in part because tau is not
  proteolytically degraded. The accumulations disturb the polymerization
  of tubulin and therefore interfere with axonal transport. Consequently,
  the shape of the neuron is not maintained.</p>
<p>Tau accumulations are also found in neurons of patients with
  progressive supranuclear palsy, a movement disorder, and in patients
  with frontotemporal dementias, a group of neurodegenerative disorders
  that affect the frontal and temporal lobes (see Chapter 59). The
  familial forms of fronto temporal dementias are caused by mutations in
  the tau gene. Abnormal aggregates are also found in glial cells, both
  astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, in progressive supranuclear palsy,
  cortico-basoganglionic degeneration, and fronto temporal dementias.</p>
<p>In Parkinson disease abnormal aggregates of α-synuclein accumulate in
  cell bodies of neurons. Like tau, α-synuclein is a normal soluble
  constituent of the cell. But in Parkinson disease it becomes insoluble,
  forming spherical inclusions called Lewy bodies (Figure 4-6C and see
  Chapter 44).</p>
<p>These abnormal inclusions also contain ubiquitin. Because ubiquitin
  is required for proteasomal degradation of proteins, its presence
  suggests that affected neurons have attempted to target α-synuclein or
  other molecular constituents for proteolysis. Apparently, degradation
  does not occur, possibly because of misfolding or the abnormal
  aggregation of the proteins or because of faulty proteolytic processing
  in the cell.</p>
<p>Do these abnormal protein accumulations affect the physiology of the
  neurons and glia? On the one hand, the accumulations may form in
  response to altered post-translational processing of the proteins and
  serve to isolate the abnormal proteins, permitting normal cell
  activities. On the other hand, the accumulations may disrupt cellular
  activities such as membrane trafficking and axonal and dendritic
  transport. In addition, the altered proteins themselves, aside from the
  aggregations, may have deleterious effects. With β-amyloid there is
  evidence that the peptide itself is toxic.</p>
<h3>Protein
  Particles and Organelles Are Actively Transported Along the Axon and
  Dendrites</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="neuronfunction" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-neuronfunction.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Passive diffusion is far too slow to deliver vesicles, particles, or
  even single macromolecules over this great distance. Membrane and
  secretory products formed in the cell body must be actively transported
  to the end of the axon.</p>
<p>Membranous organelles move toward terminals (anterograde direction)
  and back toward the cell body (retrograde direction) by <em>fast axonal
    transport</em>, a form of transport that is faster than 400 mm per day
  in warm-blooded animals. In contrast, cytosolic and cytoskeletal
  proteins move only in the anterograde direction by a much slower form of
  transport, <em>slow axonal transport</em>. These transport mechanisms in
  neurons are adaptations of processes that facilitate intracellular
  movement of organelles in all secretory cells. Because these mechanisms
  all operate along axons, they have been used by neuroanatomists to trace
  the axon distribution of neurons.</p>
<h3>Fast Axonal
  Transport Carries Membranous Organelles</h3>
<p>Large membranous organelles are carried to and from the axon
  terminals by fast transport (Figure 4-10). These organelles include
  synaptic vesicle precursors, large dense-core vesicles, mitochondria,
  elements of the smooth endoplasmic reticulum, as well as protein
  particles carrying RNAs. Direct microscopic analysis reveals that fast
  transport occurs in a stop-and-start (saltatory) fashion along linear
  tracks of microtubules aligned with the main axis of the axon. The
  saltatory nature of the movement results from the periodic dissociation
  of an organelle from the track or from collisions with other
  particles.</p>
<p>Early experiments on dorsal root ganglion cells showed that
  anterograde fast transport depends critically on ATP, is not affected by
  inhibitors of protein synthesis (once the labeled amino acid injected is
  incorporated), and does not depend on the cell body, because it occurs
  in axons severed from their cell bodies. In fact, active transport can
  occur in reconstituted cell-free axoplasm.</p>
<p>Molecular motors were first visualized in electron micrographs as
  cross bridges between microtubules and moving particles (Figure 4-7).
  The motor molecules for anterograde transport (toward the positive end
  of microtubules) are kinesin and a variety of kinesin-related proteins.
  The kinesins represent a large family of adenosine triphosphatases
  (ATPase), each of which transports different cargoes. Kinesin is a
  heterotetramer composed of two heavy chains and two light chains. Each
  heavy chain has three domains: (1) a globular head (the ATPase domain)
  that acts as the motor when attached to microtubules, (2) a coiled-coil
  helical stalk responsible for dimerization with the other heavy chain,
  and (3) a fan-like carboxyl-terminus that interacts with the light
  chains.</p>
<p>The organelles moved by retrograde fast transport are primarily
  endosomes generated by endocytic activity at nerve endings,
  mitochondria, and elements of the endoplasmic reticulum. Many of these
  components degrade in lysosomes. Retrograde fast transport also delivers
  signals that regulate gene expression in the neuron’s nucleus. For
  example, activated growth factor receptors are taken up into vesicles at
  nerve endings and carried back along the axon to their site of action in
  the nucleus. Transport of transcription factors informs the gene
  transcription apparatus in the nucleus of conditions in the periphery.
  Retrograde transport of these molecules is especially important during
  nerve regeneration and axon regrowth (see Chapter 54). Certain toxins
  (tetanus toxin) as well as pathogens (herpes simplex, rabies, and polio
  viruses) are also transported toward the cell body along the axon.</p>
<p>The rate of retrograde fast transport is approximately one-half to
  two-thirds that of anterograde fast transport. As in anterograde
  transport, particles move along microtubules. The motor molecule for
  retrograde transport is a microtubule-associated ATPase called
  MAP-1C.</p>
<p>Proteins, ribosomes, and mRNA are concentrated at the base of
  dendritic spines (Figure 4-11). Only a select group of mRNA are
  transported to the nerve terminals. These include mRNA for actin- and
  cytoskeletal- associated proteins MAP2 and the α-subunit of the
  Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase. They are translated in the
  dendrites in response to activity in a presynaptic neuron. This local
  protein synthesis is thought to be important in sustaining the molecular
  changes at the synapse that underlie long-term memory and learning.
  Likewise, the mRNA for myelin basic protein is transported to the
  distant ends of the oligodendrocytes, where it is translated as the
  myelin sheath grows, as discussed later in this chapter.</p>
<h3>Slow
  Axonal Transport Carries Cytosolic Proteins and Elements of the
  Cytoskeleton</h3>
<p>Cytosolic proteins and cytoskeletal proteins are moved from the cell
  body by slow axonal transport. Slow transport occurs only in the
  anterograde direction and consists of at least two kinetic components
  that carry different proteins at different rates.</p>
<p>The slower component travels at 0.2 to 2.5 mm per day and carries the
  proteins that make up the fibrillar elements of the cytoskeleton: the
  subunits of neurofilaments and α- and β-tubulin subunits of
  microtubules. These fibrous proteins constitute approximately 75% of the
  total protein moved in the slower component. Microtubules are
  transported in polymerized form by a mechanism involving microtubule
  sliding in which relatively short preassembled microtubules move along
  existing microtubules. Neurofilament monomers or short polymers move
  passively together with the microtubules because they are cross-linked
  by protein bridges.</p>
<p>The other component of slow axonal transport is approximately twice
  as fast as the slower. It carries clathrin, actin, and actin-binding
  proteins as well as a variety of enzymes and other proteins.</p>
<h3>Proteins
  Are Made in Neurons as in Other Secretory Cells</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="proteincreation" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-proteincreation.jpg">
</figure>
<p>The mRNAs for secretory and membrane proteins are translated in
  conjunction with the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum, and
  their polypeptide products are processed extensively within the lumen of
  the endoplasmic reticulum. Most polypeptides destined to become proteins
  are translocated across the membrane of the rough endoplasmic reticulum
  during synthesis, a process called cotranslational transfer.</p>
<p>Transfer is possible because ribosomes, the site where proteins are
  synthesized, attach to the cytosolic surface of the reticulum.</p>
<p>The ATP-ubiquitin-proteasome pathway is a mechanism for the selective
  and regulated proteolysis of proteins that operates in the cytosol of
  all regions of the neuron—dendrites, cell body, axon, and terminals.</p>
<p>Until recently this process was thought to be primarily directed to
  poorly folded, denatured, or aged and damaged proteins. We now know that
  ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis can be regulated by neuronal activity and
  plays specific roles in many neuronal processes, including
  synaptogenesis and long-term memory storage.</p>
<h3>Glial Cells
  Play Diverse Roles in Neural Function</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="myelination" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-myelination.jpg">
</figure>
<p>One Schwann cell produces a single myelin sheath for one segment of
  one axon, whereas one oligodendrocyte produces myelin sheaths for
  segments of as many as 30 axons.</p>
<p>The number of layers of myelin on an axon is proportional to the
  diameter of the axon—larger axons have thicker sheaths. Axons with very
  small diameters are not myelinated; nonmyelinated axons conduct action
  potentials much more slowly than do myelinated axons because of their
  smaller diameter and lack of myelin insulation.</p>
<p>The regularly spaced segments of myelin sheath are separated by
  unmyelinated gaps, called nodes of Ranvier, where the plasma membrane of
  the axon is exposed to the extracellular space for approximately 1 µm
  (Figure 4-14). This arrangement greatly increases the speed at which
  nerve impulses are conducted (up to 100 m/s in humans) because the
  signal jumps from one node to the next, a mechanism called saltatory
  conduction (see Chapter 6). Nodes are easily excited because they have a
  low threshold. In the axon membrane at the nodes the density of Na+
  channels, which generate the action potential, is approximately 50 times
  greater than in myelin-sheathed regions of membrane. Several cell
  adhesion molecules in the paranodal regions keep the myelin boundaries
  stable.</p>
<p>Demyelination slows down, or even stops, conduction of the action
  potential in an affected axon, because it allows electrical current to
  leak out of the axonal membrane.</p>
<h3>Astrocytes Support
  Synaptic Signaling</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="astrocytes" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-astrocytes.jpg">
</figure>
<p>Astrocytes are star-shaped glia found in all areas of the brain;
  indeed, they constitute nearly half the number of brain cells. They play
  important roles in nourishing neurons and in regulating the
  concentrations of ions and neurotransmitters in the extracellular space.
  But astrocytes and neurons also communicate with each other to modulate
  synaptic signaling in ways that are still poorly understood.</p>
<p>Astrocytes have large numbers of thin processes that enfold all the
  blood vessels of the brain, and ensheath synapses or groups of synapses.
  By their intimate physical association with synapses, often closer than
  1 µm, astrocytes are positioned to regulate extra-cellular
  concentrations of ions, neurotransmitters, and other molecules.</p>
<p>C. The processes of astrocytes are intimately associated with both
  presynaptic and postsynaptic elements.</p>
<ol>
  <li>The close association between astrocyte processes and synapses is
    seen in this electron micrograph of hippocampal cells. (Reproduced, with
    permission, from Ventura and Harris 1999.)
  </li>
  <li>Glutamate released from the presynaptic neuron activates not only
    receptors on the postsynaptic neuron but also
    α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionate (AMPA) receptors on
    astrocytes. Astrocytes remove glutamate from the synaptic cleft by
    uptake through high-affinity transporters. (Reproduced, with permission,
    from Gallo and Chittajallu 2001.)
  </li>
</ol>
<p>How do astrocytes regulate axonal conduction and synaptic activity?
  The first recognized physiologicalrole was that of K+ buffering. When
  neurons fire action potentials they release K+ ions into the
  extracellular space. Because astrocytes have high concentrations of K+
  channels in their membranes, they can act as <em>spa–tial buffers</em>:
  They take up K+ at sites of neuronal activity, mainly synapses, and
  release it at distant contacts with blood vessels. Astrocytes can also
  accumulate K+ locally within their cytoplasmic processes along with Cl–
  ions and water. Unfortunately, accumulation of ions and water in
  astrocytes can contribute to severe brain swelling after head
  injury.</p>
<p>Astrocytes also regulate neurotransmitter concentrations in the
  brain. For example, high-affinity transporters located in the
  astrocyte’s plasma membrane rapidly clear the neurotransmitter glutamate
  from the synaptic cleft (Figure 4-17C). Once within the glial cell,
  glutamate is converted to glutamine by the enzyme glutamine synthetase.
  Glutamine is then transferred to neurons, where it serves as an
  immediate precursor of glutamate (see Chapter 13). Interference with
  these uptake mechanisms results in high concentrations of extracellular
  glutamate that can lead to the death of neurons, a process termed
  excitotoxicity. Astrocytes also degrade dopamine, norepinephrine,
  epinephrine, and serotonin.</p>
<p>Astrocytes sense when neurons are active because they are depolarized
  by the K+ released by neurons and have neurotransmitter receptors
  similar to those of neurons. For example, Bergmann glia in the
  cerebellum express glutamate receptors. Thus, the glutamate released at
  cerebellar synapses affects not only postsynaptic neurons but also
  astrocytes near the synapse. The binding of these ligands to glial
  receptors increases the intracellular free Ca2+ concentration, which has
  several important consequences. The processes of one astrocyte connect
  to those of neighboring astrocytes through gap junctions, allowing
  transfer of ions and small molecules between many cells. An increase in
  free Ca2+ within one astrocyte increases Ca2+ concentrations in adjacent
  astrocytes. This spread of Ca2+ through the astrocyte network occurs
  over hundreds of micrometers. It is likely that this Ca2+ wave modulates
  nearby neuronal activity by triggering the release of nutrients and
  regulating blood flow. An increase in Ca2+ in astrocytes leads to the
  secretion of signals that enhance synaptic function, but the specific
  molecular components of these signals are not understood.</p>
<p>Astrocytes also are important for the development of synapses. They
  prepare the surface of the neuron for synapse formation and stabilize
  newly formed synapses. For example, astrocytes secrete substances called
  thrombospondins that promote the formation of new synapses. In
  pathological states, such as chromatolysis produced by axonal damage,
  astrocytes and presynaptic terminals temporarily retract from the
  damaged postsynaptic cell bodies. Astrocytes release neurotrophic and
  gliotrophic factors that promote the development and survival of neurons
  and oligodendrocytes. Astrocytes also protect other cells from the
  effects of oxidative stress. For example, the glutathione peroxidase in
  astrocytes detoxifies toxic oxygen free radicals released during
  hypoxia, inflammation, and neuronal degeneration.</p>
<p>Finally, astrocytes ensheath small arterioles and capillaries
  throughout the brain, forming contacts between the ends of astrocyte
  processes and the basal lamina around endothelial cells. The central
  nervous system is sequestered from the general circulation so that
  macromolecules in the blood do not passively enter the brain and spinal
  cord (the “blood-brain barrier”). The barrier is largely the result of
  tight junctions between endothelial cells and cerebral capillaries, a
  feature not shared by capillaries in other parts of the body (see
  Appendix D). Nevertheless, endothelial cells have a number of transport
  properties that allow some molecules to pass through them into the
  nervous system. Because of the intimate astrocyte–blood vessel contacts,
  the transported molecules, such as glucose, come into contact with and
  can be taken up by astrocyte end-feet.</p>
<h3>Choroid
  Plexus and Ependymal Cells Produce Cerebrospinal Fluid</h3>
<p>Cells of the ependyma and choroid plexus are derived from immature
  neuroepithelium. The ependyma, a single layer of ciliated cuboidal
  cells, lines all the ventricles of the brain, helping to move
  cerebrospinal fluid through the ventricular system (Figure 4-18A). At
  several places in the lateral and fourth ventricles the ependyma is
  continuous with cells of the choroid plexus, which covers thin blood
  vessels that project into the ventricles (Figure 4-18B). These choroid
  plexus epithelial cells filter plasma from the blood and secrete this
  ultrafiltrate as cerebrospinal fluid.</p>
<h3>Microglia
  in the Brain Are Derived from Bone Marrow</h3>
<p>Unlike neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes, microglia do not
  belong to the neuroectodermal lineage. Instead they derive from bone
  marrow. Entering the central nervous system early in development, they
  reside in all regions of the brain throughout life (Figure 4-19). Their
  functions are not well understood, although they probably play an
  important role in immunological surveillance in the CNS, poised to react
  to foreign invaders.</p>
<p>Of all of the cells in the central nervous system, microglia are the
  best at processing and presenting antigens to lymphocytes and secreting
  cytokines and chemokines during inflammation. Thus they serve to bring
  lymphocytes, neutrophils, and monocytes into the central nervous system
  and expand the lymphocyte population, important immunological activities
  in infection, stroke, and immune-mediated demyelinating disease.
  Microglia can also become macrophages, clearing debris after infarcts
  (strokes) or other degenerative neurological disorders.</p>
<h3>An Overall View</h3>
<p>Most neuronal proteins are synthesized in the cell body, but some
  synthesis occurs in dendrites and axons. The newly synthesized proteins
  are folded with the assistance of chaperones, and their final structure
  is often modified by permanent or reversible posttranslational
  modifications. The final destination of a protein in the neuron depends
  on signals encoded in its amino acid sequence. Transport of proteins and
  RNA occurs with great specificity and results in the vectorial transport
  of selected membrane components. The cytoskeleton provides an important
  framework for the transport of organelles to different intracellular
  locations in addition to controlling neuronal shape.</p>
<h2>Ion Channels</h2>
<p>In sensory cells, the membrane potential changes in response to
  minute physical stimuli: Receptors in the eye respond to a single photon
  of light; olfactory neurons detect a single molecule of odorant; and
  hair cells in the inner ear respond to tiny movements of atomic
  dimensions. These sensory responses ultimately lead to the firing of an
  action potential during which the membrane potential changes up to 500
  volts per second.</p>
<h3>Rapid
  Signaling in the Nervous System Depends on Ion Channels</h3>
<p>Ion channels have three important properties: (1) They recognize and
  select specific ions, (2) they open and close in response to specific
  electrical, mechanical, or chemical signals, and (3) they conduct ions
  across the membrane. The channels in nerve and muscle conduct ions
  across the cell membrane at extremely rapid rates, thereby providing a
  large flow of electric charge. Up to 100 million ions can pass through a
  single channel each second. This current causes the rapid changes in
  membrane potential required for signaling.</p>
<p>In light of such an extraordinary rate of ion flow, channels are
  surprisingly selective for the ions they allow to permeate. Each type of
  channel allows only one or a few types of ions to pass. For example, the
  negative resting potential of nerve cells is largely determined by a
  class of K+ channels that are 100-fold more permeable to K+ than to Na+.
  In contrast, during the action potential a class of Na+ channels is
  activated that are 10- to 20-fold more permeable to Na+ than to K+.</p>
<p>Many channels open and close in response to a specific event:
  Voltage-gated channels are regulated by changes in membrane potential,
  ligand-gated channels by chemical transmitters, and mechanically gated
  channels by pressure or stretch. However, some channels are normally
  open in the cell at rest. The ion flux through these “resting” channels
  contributes significantly to the resting potential.</p>
<h3>Ion
  Channels Are Proteins That Span the Cell Membrane</h3>
<figure class="figura">
  <img alt="ionchannels" src="../../img/notes/content/principlesofneuralscience-ionchannels.jpg">
</figure>
<p>The plasma membrane of all cells, including nerve cells, is
  approximately 6 to 8 nm thick and consists of a mosaic of lipids and
  proteins. The core of the membrane is formed by a double layer of
  phospholipids. Embedded within this continuous lipid sheet are integral
  membrane proteins, including ion channels.</p>
<p>The lipids of the membrane do not mix with water—they are
  hydrophobic. In contrast, the ions within the cell and those outside
  strongly attract water molecules—they are hydrophilic (Figure 5-1). Ions
  attract water because water molecules are dipolar: Although the net
  charge on a water molecule is zero, charge is separated within the
  molecule. The oxygen atom in a water molecule tends to attract electrons
  and so bears a small net negative charge, whereas the hydrogen atoms
  tend to lose electrons and therefore carry a small net positive charge.
  As a result of this unequal distribution of charge, positively charged
  ions (cations) are strongly attracted electrostatically to the oxygen
  atom of water, and negatively charged ions (anions) are attracted to the
  hydrogen atoms. Similarly, ions attract water; in fact they become
  surrounded by electrostatically bound waters of hydration.</p>
<p>Potassium channels have a narrow pore that excludes Na+. Although a
  Na+ ion is smaller than a K+ ion, in solution the effective diameter of
  Na+ is larger because its local field strength is more intense, causing
  it to attract a larger cloud of water molecules. The K+ channel pore is
  too narrow for the hydrated Na+ ion to permeate.</p>
<p>Sodium channels have a selectivity filter that weakly binds Na+ ions.
  According to the hypothesis developed by Bertil Hille and colleagues, a
  Na+ ion binds transiently at an active site as it moves through the
  filter. At the binding site the positive charge of the ion is stabilized
  by a negatively charged amino acid residue on the channel wall and also
  by a water molecule that is attracted to a second polar amino acid
  residue on the other side of the channel wall. It is thought that a K+
  ion, because of its larger diameter, cannot be stabilized as effectively
  by the negative charge and therefore will be excluded from the filter.
  (Modified, with permission, from Hille 1984.)</p>
<p>An ion cannot move away from water into the noncharged hydrocarbon
  tails of the lipid bilayer in the membrane unless a large amount of
  energy is expended to overcome the attraction between the ion and the
  surrounding water molecules. For this reason it is extremely unlikely
  that an ion will move from solution into the lipid bilayer, and
  therefore the bilayer itself is almost completely impermeable to ions.
  Rather, ions cross the membrane through ion channels, specialized pores
  or openings in the membrane where, as we shall see, the energetics favor
  ion movement.</p>
<p>Even though we now know that ions can cross membranes by means of a
  variety of transport macromolecules, the Na+-K+ pump being a
  well-characterized example (Chapter 6), many properties of membrane ion
  conductances do not fit the carrier model. Most important is the rapid
  rate of ion transfer across membranes. This transfer rate was first
  examined in the early 1970s by measuring the transmembrane current
  initiated when the neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) binds its
  receptor in the cell membrane of skeletal muscle fibers at the synapse
  between nerve and muscle. Using measurements of membrane current noise,
  small statistical fluctuations in the mean ionic current induced by ACh,
  Bernard Katz and Ricardo Miledi concluded that the current conducted by
  a single ACh receptor is 10 million ions per second. In contrast, the
  Na+-K+ pump transports at most 100 ions per second.</p>
<p>This selectivity results because the electrostatic interaction
  between two charged groups, as governed by Coulomb’s law, depends
  inversely on the distance between the two groups.</p>
<p>Because Na+ has a smaller crystal radius than K+, it will approach a
  negative site more closely than K+, and thus will derive a more
  favorable free-energy change on binding. This compensates for the
  requirement that Na+ lose some of its waters of hydration to traverse
  the narrow selectivity filter. In contrast, a binding site with a low
  negative strength—one that is composed, for example, of polar carbonyl
  or hydroxyl oxygen atoms—would select K+ over Na+. At such a site the
  binding of Na+ would not provide a sufficient free-energy change to
  compensate for the loss of the ion’s waters of hydration, which Na+
  holds strongly. However, such a site would be able to compensate for the
  loss of a K+ ion’s associated water molecules as the larger K+ ions
  interact more weakly with water. It is currently thought that ion
  channels are selective both because of specific chemical interactions
  and because of molecular sieving based on pore diameter.</p>
<h3>Ion
  Channels in All Cells Share Several Characteristics</h3>
<p>Most cells are capable of local signaling, but only nerve and muscle
  cells are specialized for rapid signaling over long distances. Although
  nerve and muscle cells have a particularly rich variety and high density
  of membrane ion channels, their channels do not differ fundamentally
  from those of other cells in the body.</p>
<h4>The Flux of Ions
  Through a Channel Is Passive</h4>
<p>The flux of ions through ion channels is passive, requiring no
  expenditure of metabolic energy by the channels. The direction and
  eventual equilibrium for this flux are determined not by the channel
  itself, but rather by the electrostatic and diffusional driving forces
  across the membrane.</p>
<p>Ion channels allow particular types of ions to cross the membrane,
  selecting either cations or anions to permeate. Some types of
  cation-selective channels allow the cations that are usually present in
  extracellular fluid—Na+, K+, Ca2+, and Mg2+—to pass almost
  indiscriminately. However, many other cation-selective channels are
  permeable primarily to a single type of ion, whether it is Na+, K+, or
  Ca2+. Most types of anion-selective channels are also highly
  discriminating; they conduct only one physiological ion, chloride
  (Cl–).</p>
<p>The kinetic properties of ion permeation are best described by the
  channel’s conductance, which is determined by measuring the current (ion
  flux) through the open channel in response to an electrochemical driving
  force. The net electrochemical driving force is determined by two
  factors: the electrical potential difference across the membrane and the
  concentration gradients of the permeant ions across the membrane.
  Changing either one can change the net driving force.</p>
<p>The rate of net ion flux (current) through a channel depends on the
  concentration of the permeant ions in the surrounding solution. At low
  concentrations the current increases almost linearly with concentration.
  At higher concentrations the current tends to reach a point at which it
  no longer increases. At this point the current is said to saturate.</p>
<p>This saturation effect is consistent with the idea that ion flux
  across the cell membrane is not strictly a function of laws of
  electrochemical diffusion in free solution but also involves the binding
  of ions to specific polar sites within the pore of the channel. A simple
  electrodiffusion model would predict that the ionic current should
  continue to increase as long as the ionic concentration also increases;
  that is, the more charge carriers in solution, the greater the
  current.</p>
<p>This weak interaction indicates that the bonds between the ion and
  the channel are rapidly formed and broken. In fact, an ion typically
  stays bound in the channel for less than 1 µs. The rapid rate at which
  an ion unbinds is necessary for the channel to achieve the very high
  conduction rates responsible for the rapid changes in membrane potential
  during signaling.</p>
<p>Some ion channels are susceptible to occlusion by certain free ions
  or molecules in the cytoplasm or extracellular fluid. Passage through
  the channel can be blocked by particles that bind either to the mouth of
  the aqueous pore or somewhere within the pore. If the blocker is an
  ionized molecule that binds to a site within the pore, it will be
  influenced by the membrane electric field as it enters the channel. For
  example, if a positively charged blocker enters the channel from outside
  the membrane, then making the cytoplasmic side of the membrane more
  negative—which, according to convention, corresponds to a more negative
  membrane potential (see Chapter 6)—will drive the blocker into the
  channel through an electrostatic attraction, increasing the block.
  Although blockers are often toxins or drugs that originate outside the
  body, some are common ions that are normally present in the cell or its
  environment. Physiological blockers of certain classes of channels
  include Mg2+, Ca2+, Na+, and polyamines such as spermine.</p>
<h4>The
  Opening and Closing of a Channel Involve Conformational Changes</h4>
<p>In all ion channels so far studied the channel protein has two or
  more conformational states that are relatively stable. Each of these
  stable conformations represents a different functional state. For
  example, each ion channel has at least one open state and one or two
  closed states. The transition of a channel between these different
  states is called <em>gating</em>.</p>
<p>The molecular rearrangements that occur during the transition from
  closed to open states appear to enhance ion conduction through the
  channel not only by creating a wider lumen, but also by positioning
  relatively more polar amino acid constituents at the surface that lines
  the aqueous pore.</p>
<p>The primary function of ion channels in neurons is to generate
  transient electrical signals, and three major gating mechanisms have
  evolved to control channel opening (Figure 5-5).</p>

    <p>A. A ligand-gated channel opens when a ligand binds a receptor site
      on the external surface of the channel protein. The energy from ligand
      binding drives the channel toward an open state.</p>
    <p>B. Some channels are regulated by protein phosphorylation and
      dephosphorylation. The energy for channel opening comes from the
      transfer of the high-energy phosphate, Pi.</p>
    <p>C. Voltage-gated channels open and close with changes in the
      electrical potential difference across the membrane. The change in
      membrane potential causes a local conformational change by acting on a
      region of the channel that has a net charge.</p>
    <p>D. Some channels open and close through stretch or pressure. The
      energy for gating may come from mechanical forces that are passed to the
      channel through the cytoskeleton.</p>
  </footer>
</figure>
<p>The rapid gating actions necessary for moment-to-moment signaling may
  also be influenced by certain long-term changes in the metabolic state
  of the cell. For example, the gating of some K+ channels is sensitive to
  intracellular levels of ATP. Some channel proteins contain a subunit
  with an integral oxidoreductase catalytic domain that is thought to
  alter channel gating in response to the redox state of the cell.</p>
<p>These regulators control the entry of a channel into one of three
  functional states: closed and activatable (resting), open (active), or
  closed and nonactivatable (refractory). A change in the functional state
  of a channel requires energy. In voltage-gated channels the energy is
  provided by the movement of a charged region of the channel protein
  through the membrane’s electric field. This region, the voltage sensor,
  contains a net electric charge because of the presence of basic
  (positively charged) or acidic (negatively charged) amino acids. The
  movement of the charged voltage sensor through the electric field
  imparts a change in free energy to the channel that alters the
  equilibrium between the closed and open states of the channel. For most
  voltage-gated channels, channel opening is favored by making the inside
  of the membrane more positive (depolarization).</p>
<p>In transmitter-gated channels gating is driven by the change in
  chemical-free energy that results when the transmitter binds to a
  receptor site on the channel protein. For mechanically activated
  channels the energy associated with membrane stretch is thought to be
  transferred to the channel either through the cytoskeleton or more
  directly by changes in tension of the lipid bilayer.</p>
<p>The stimuli that gate the channel also control the rates of
  transition between the open and closed states of a channel. For
  voltage-gated channels the rates are steeply dependent on membrane
  potential. Although the time scale can vary from several microseconds to
  a minute, the transition tends to require a few milliseconds on average.
  Thus, once a channel opens it stays open for a few milliseconds before
  closing, and after closing it stays closed for a few milliseconds before
  reopening. Once the transition between open and closed states begins, it
  proceeds virtually instantaneously (in less than 10 µs, the present
  limit of experimental measurements), thus giving rise to abrupt,
  all-or-none, step-like changes in current through the channel.</p>
<p>Many, but not all, voltage-gated channels enter a refractory state
  after opening, a process termed inactivation. In the inactive state the
  channel is closed and can no longer be opened by positive voltages.
  Rather, the membrane potential must be returned to its initial negative
  resting level before the channel can recover from inactivation so that
  it can again open in response to depolarization. In voltage-gated Na+,
  and K+ channels inactivation is thought to result from a conformational
  change, controlled by a subunit or region of the channel separate from
  that which controls activation.</p>

    <p>A. Channels have a continuous aqueous pathway for ion conduction
      across the membrane. This pathway can be occluded by the closing of a
      gate.</p>
    <p>B. Pumps have two gates in series that control ion flux. The gates
      are never open simultaneously, but both can close to trap one or more
      ions in the pore. The type of pump illustrated here moves two different
      types of ions in opposite directions and is termed an exchanger or
      antiporter. Ion movement is tightly linked to a cycle of opening and
      closing of the two gates. When the external gate is open, one type of
      ion (red) leaves while the other type (blue) enters the channel (1).
      This triggers a conformational change, causing the external gate to
      shut, thereby trapping the incoming ion (2). A second conformational
      change then causes the internal gate to open, allowing the trapped ion
      to leave and a new ion to enter (3). A further conformational change
      opens the external gate, allowing the cycle to continue (4). With each
      cycle, one type of ion is transported from the outside to the inside of
      the cell, whereas the other type is transported from the inside to the
      outside of the cell. By coupling the movements of two or more ions, an
      exchanger can use the energy stored in the concentration gradient of one
      ion to actively transport another ion against its concentration
      gradient.</p>

<h2>Membrane
  Potential and the Passive Electrical Properties of the Neuron</h2>
<p>The membrane potential of a cell at rest is called the resting
  membrane potential (Vr). Since by convention the potential outside the
  cell is defined as zero, the resting potential is equal to Vin. Its
  usual range is –60 mV to –70 mV. All electrical signaling involves brief
  changes in the resting membrane potential that are caused by electrical
  currents across the cell membrane.</p>
<p>The electric current is carried by ions, both positive (cations) and
  negative (anions). The direction of current is conventionally defined as
  the direction of net movement of positive charge.</p>
<p>Changes in membrane potential that do not lead to the opening of
  gated ion channels are passive responses of the membrane and are called
  <em>electrotonic potentials</em>. Hyperpolarizing responses are almost
  always passive, as are small depolarizations. However, when
  depolarization approaches a critical level, or threshold, the cell
  responds actively with the opening of voltage-gated ion channels, which
  produces an all-or-none <em>action potential.</em></p>
<h3>The
  Resting Membrane Potential Is Determined by Nongated and Gated Ion
  Channels</h3>
<p>The resting membrane potential is the result of the passive flux of
  individual ion species through several classes of resting channels.
  Understanding how this passive ionic flux gives rise to the resting
  potential enables us to understand how the gating of different types of
  ion channels generates the action potential, as well as the receptor and
  synaptic potentials.</p>
<p>No single ion species is distributed equally on the two sides of a
  nerve cell membrane. Of the four most abundant ions found on either side
  of the cell membrane, Na+, and Cl– are concentrated outside the cell and
  K+, and organic anions (A–, primarily amino acids and proteins)
  inside.</p>
<p>Once K+ diffusion has proceeded to a certain point, the electrical
  driving force on K+ exactly balances the chemical driving force. That
  is, the outward movement of K+ (driven by its concentration gradient) is
  equal to the inward movement of K+ (driven by the electrical potential
  difference across the membrane). This potential is called the K+
  equilibrium potential, EK (Figure 6-3). In a cell permeable only to K+
  ions, EK determines the resting membrane potential, which in most glial
  cells is approximately –75 mV.</p>
<p>The equilibrium potential for any ion <em>X</em> can be calculated
  from an equation derived in 1888 from basic thermodynamic principles by
  the German physical chemist Walter <strong>Nernst</strong>.</p>
<p>The influx of Na+ depolarizes the cell, but only slightly from the K+
  equilibrium potential (–75 mV). The new membrane potential does not come
  close to the Na+ equilibrium potential of +55 mV because there are many
  more resting K+ channels than Na+ channels in the membrane.</p>
<p>The more the membrane potential is depolarized and driven away from
  the K+ equilibrium potential, the greater is the net electrochemical
  force driving K+ out of the cell and consequently the greater the net K+
  efflux. Eventually, the membrane potential reaches a new resting level
  at which the increased outward movement of K+ just balances the inward
  movement of Na+. This balance point (usually approximately –65 mV) is
  far from the Na+ equilibrium potential (+55 mV) and is only slightly
  more positive than the K+ equilibrium potential (–75 mV).</p>
<p>In a resting nerve cell relatively few Na+ channels are open, so the
  membrane conductance of Na+ is quite low. Thus, despite the large
  chemical and electrical forces driving Na+ into the cell, the influx of
  Na+ is small. In contrast, many K+ channels are open in the membrane of
  a resting cell so that the membrane conductance of K+ is relatively
  large. Because of the high relative conductance of Na+ to K+ in the cell
  at rest, the small net outward force acting on K+ is enough to produce a
  K+ efflux equal to the Na+ influx.</p>
<h3>The
  Electrochemical Gradients of Sodium, Potassium, and Calcium Are
  Established by Active Transport of the Ions</h3>
<p>For a cell to have a steady resting membrane potential, the charge
  separation across the membrane must be constant over time. That is, at
  every instant the influx of positive charge must be balanced by the
  efflux of positive charge. If these fluxes were not equal, the charge
  separation across the membrane, and thus the membrane potential, would
  vary continually.</p>
<p>As we have seen, the passive movement of K+ out of the resting cell
  through open channels balances the passive movement of Na+ into the
  cell. However, this steady leakage of ions cannot be allowed to continue
  unopposed for any appreciable length of time because the Na+, and K+
  gradients would eventually run down, reducing the resting membrane
  potential.</p>
<p>Dissipation of ionic gradients is prevented by the sodium-potassium
  pump (Na+-K+ pump), which moves Na+, and K+ against their
  electrochemical gradients: It extrudes Na+ from the cell while taking in
  K+. The pump therefore requires energy, and the energy comes from
  hydrolysis of ATP (Figure 6-5A). Thus at the resting membrane potential
  the cell is not in equilibrium but rather in a steady state: There is a
  continuous passive influx of Na+, and efflux of K+ through resting
  channels that is exactly counterbalanced by the Na+-K+ pump.</p>
<p>It uses this energy of hydrolysis to extrude three Na+ ions from the
  cell and bring in two K+ ions. The unequal flux of Na+, and K+ ions
  causes the pump to generate a net outward ionic current. Thus, the pump
  is said to be electrogenic. This pump-driven efflux of positive charge
  tends to set the resting potential a few millivolts more negative than
  would be achieved by the passive diffusion mechanisms discussed above.
  During periods of intense neuronal activity the increased influx of Na+
  leads to an increase in Na+-K+ pump activity that generates a prolonged
  outward current, leading to a prolonged hyperpolarizing after-potential
  that can last for several minutes, until the normal Na+ concentration is
  restored.</p>
<p>Ultimately, it is the hydrolysis of ATP by the Na+-K+ pump that
  provides the energy (stored in the Na+ gradient) to maintain the
  function of the Na+-Ca2+ exchanger. For this reason, ion flux driven by
  cotransporters is often referred to as secondary active transport, to
  distinguish it from the primary active transport driven directly by
  ATPases.</p>
<h3>Chloride Ions Are
  Also Actively Transported</h3>
<p>However, in most neurons the Cl– gradient is determined by
  cotransporters that move Cl– out of the cell. This action lowers the
  intracellular concentration of Cl– so that ECl is typically more
  negative than the resting potential. As a result, the opening of Cl–
  channels leads to an influx of Cl– that hyperpolarizes the membrane. The
  K+-Cl– cotransporter is an example of such a transport mechanism; it
  moves one K+ ion out of the cell for each Cl– ion it exports.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in early neuronal development cells tend to express
  primarily the Na+-K+-Cl– cotransporter. At this stage the
  neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA), which activates Cl–
  channels, typically has an excitatory (depolarizing) effect. As neurons
  develop they begin to express the K+-Cl– cotransporter, such that in
  mature neurons GABA typically hyperpolarizes the membrane and thus acts
  as an inhibitory neurotransmitter. In some pathological conditions in
  adults, such as certain types of epilepsy or chronic pain syndromes, the
  expression pattern of the Cl– cotransporters may revert to that of the
  immature nervous system. This will lead to aberrant depolarizing
  responses to GABA that can produce abnormally high levels of
  excitation.</p>
<h3>The
  Balance of Ion Fluxes That Maintains the Resting Membrane Potential Is
  Abolished During the Action Potential</h3>
<p>The increase in depolarization causes still more voltage-gated Na+
  channels to open, resulting in a greater influx of Na+, which
  accelerates the depolarization even further.</p>
<p>This regenerative, positive feedback cycle develops explosively,
  driving the membrane potential toward the Na+ equilibrium potential of
  +55 mV.</p>
<p>However, the membrane potential never quite reaches ENa because K+
  efflux continues throughout the depolarization. A slight influx of Cl–
  into the cell also counteracts the depolarizing effect of the Na+
  influx. Nevertheless, so many voltage-gated Na+ channels open during the
  rising phase of the action potential that the cell membrane’s Na+
  conductance is much greater than the conductance of either Cl– or K+.
  Thus, at the peak of the action potential the membrane potential
  approaches the Na+ equilibrium potential, just as at rest (when
  permeability to K+ is predominant) the membrane potential tends to
  approach the K+ equilibrium potential.</p>
<p>The membrane potential would remain at this large positive value near
  the Na+ equilibrium potential indefinitely but for two processes that
  repolarize the membrane, thus terminating the action potential. First,
  following the peak of the action potential the voltage-gated Na+
  channels gradually close by the process of inactivation (see Chapters 5
  and 7). Second, opening of the voltage-gated K+ channels causes the K+
  efflux to gradually increase. The increase in K+ conductance is slower
  than the increase in Na+ conductance because of the slower rate of
  opening of the voltage-gated K+ channels. The slow increase in K+ efflux
  together with the decrease in Na+ influx produces a net efflux of
  positive charge from the cell, which continues until the cell has
  repolarized to its resting membrane potential.</p>
<h3>Membrane
  and Axoplasmic Resistance Affect the Efficiency of Signal
  Conduction</h3>
<p>The efficiency of electrotonic conduction has two important effects
  on neuronal function. First, it influences spatial summation, the
  process by which synaptic potentials generated in different regions of
  the neuron are added together at the trigger zone at the axon hillock
  (see Chapter 10). Second, electrotonic conduction is a factor in the
  propagation of the action potential. Once the membrane at any point
  along an axon has been depolarized beyond threshold, an action potential
  is generated in that region. This local depolarization spreads passively
  down the axon, causing successive adjacent regions of the membrane to
  reach the threshold for generating an action potential (Figure 6-17).
  Thus the depolarization spreads along the length of the axon by local
  current driven by the difference in potential between the active and
  resting regions of the axon membrane. In axons with longer length
  constants local current spreads a greater distance down the axon, and
  therefore the action potential propagates more rapidly.</p>
<p>In general, axons with the largest diameter have the lowest threshold
  for excitation. The greater the diameter of the axon, the lower the
  axial resistance to the flow of current down the axon because the number
  of charge carriers (ions) per unit length of the axon is greater.
  Because more current enters the larger axon, the axon is depolarized
  more efficiently than a smaller axon. For these reasons, larger axons
  are recruited at low values of current; axons with smaller diameter are
  recruited only at relatively greater current strengths.</p>
<h3>Passive
  Membrane Properties and Axon Diameter Affect the Velocity of Action
  Potential Propagation</h3>
<p>Rapid propagation of the action potential is functionally important,
  and two adaptive strategies have evolved to increase it. One is an
  increase in the diameter of the axon core. Because ra decreases in
  proportion to the square of axon diameter, whereas cm increases in
  direct proportion to diameter, the net effect of an increase in diameter
  is a decrease in racm. This adaptation has been carried to an extreme in
  the giant axon of the squid, which can reach a diameter of 1 mm. No
  larger axons have evolved, presumably because of the competing need to
  keep neuronal size small so that many cells can be packed into a limited
  space.</p>
<p>The second strategy to increase conduction velocity is the wrapping
  of a myelin sheath around an axon (see Chapter 4). This process is
  functionally equivalent to increasing the thickness of the axonal
  membrane by as much as 100 times. Because the capacitance of a
  parallel-plate capacitor such as the membrane is inversely proportional
  to the thickness of the insulation material (see Appendix A),
  myelination decreases cm and thus racm. Myelination results in a
  proportionately much greater decrease in racm than does the same
  increase in the diameter of the axon core because the many layers of
  membrane wrapped in the myelin sheath produce a very large decrease in
  cm. For this reason, conduction in myelinated axons is faster than in
  nonmyelinated axons of the same diameter.</p>
<p>To prevent the action potential from dying out, the myelin sheath is
  interrupted every 1 to 2 mm by bare patches of axon membrane
  approximately 1 µm in length, the nodes of Ranvier (see Chapter 4).
  Although the area of membrane at each node is quite small, the nodal
  membrane is rich in voltage-gated Na+ channels and thus can generate an
  intense depolarizing inward Na+ current in response to the passive
  spread of depolarization down the axon. These regularly distributed
  nodes thus boost the amplitude of the action potential periodically,
  preventing it from decaying with distance.</p>

    <p>A. The densities of capacitive and ionic membrane currents (membrane
      current per unit area of membrane) are much higher at the nodes of
      Ranvier than in the internodal regions. (In the figure the density of
      membrane current at any point along the axon is represented by the
      thickness of the arrows.) Because of the higher capacitance of the axon
      membrane at the nodes, the action potential slows down as it approaches
      each node and thus appears to skip rapidly from node to node as it
      propagates from left to right.</p>
    <p>B. In regions of the axon that have lost their myelin, the spread of
      the action potential is slowed down or blocked. The local-circuit
      currents must discharge a larger membrane capacitance and, because of
      the shorter length constant (caused by the low membrane resistance in
      demyelinated stretches of axon), they do not spread well down the
      axon.</p>

</figure>
<h3>An Overall View</h3>
<p>The value of the resting membrane potential in nerve cells is
  determined primarily by resting channels that conduct K+, Cl–, and Na+.
  In general, the membrane potential is closest to the equilibrium
  (Nernst) potential of the ion (or ions) with the greatest membrane
  permeability. The permeability of a cell membrane for an ion species is
  proportional to the number of open channels that allow passage of that
  ion.</p>
<p>The resting membrane potential is close to the Nernst potential for
  K+, the ion to which the membrane is most permeable.</p>
<h2>Propagated Signaling:
  The Action Potential</h2>
<p>Action potentials have four properties important for neuronal
  signaling.</p>
<ol>
  <li>First, they have a threshold for initiation. As we saw in Chapter 6,
    in many nerve cells the membrane behaves as a simple resistor in
    response to small hyperpolarizing or depolarizing current steps. The
    membrane voltage changes in a graded manner as a function of the size of
    the current step according to Ohm’s law, (in terms of conductance).
    However, as the size of the depolarizing current increases, eventually a
    threshold voltage is reached, typically at around –50 mV, at which point
    an action potential is generated (see Figure 6-2C).
  </li>
  <li>Second, the action potential is an all-or-none event. The size and
    shape of an action potential initiated by a large depolarizing current
    is the same as that of an action potential evoked by a current that just
    surpasses the threshold.
  </li>
  <li>Third, the action potential is conducted without decrement. It has a
    self-regenerative feature that keeps the amplitude constant, even when
    it is conducted over great distances.
  </li>
  <li>Fourth, the action potential is followed by a refractory period. For
    a brief time after an action potential is generated, the neuron’s
    ability to fire a second action potential is suppressed. The refractory
    period limits the frequency at which a nerve can fire action potentials,
    and thus limits the information-carrying capacity of the axon.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>These four properties of the action potential—initiation threshold,
  all-or-none nature, conduction without decrement, and refractory
  period—are unusual for biological processes, which typically respond in
  a graded fashion to changes in the environment. Biologists were puzzled
  by these properties for almost 100 years after the action potential was
  first measured in the mid 1800s. Finally, in the late 1940s and early
  1950s studies of the membrane properties of the giant axon of the squid
  by Alan Hodgkin, Andrew Huxley, and Bernard Katz provided the first
  quantitative insight into the mechanisms underlying the action
  potential.</p>
<h3>Sodium
  and Potassium Currents Through Voltage-Gated Channels Are Recorded with
  the Voltage Clamp</h3>
<p>They found that the Na+, and K+ currents vary as a graded function of
  the membrane potential. As the membrane voltage is made more positive,
  the outward K+ current becomes larger. The inward Na+ current also
  becomes larger with increases in depolarization, up to a certain extent.
  However, as the voltage becomes more and more positive, the Na+ current
  eventually declines in amplitude. When the membrane potential is +55 mV,
  the Na+ current is zero. Positive to +55 mV, the Na+ current reverses
  direction and becomes outward.</p>

  Sodium and Potassium Conductances Are Calculated from Their
  Currents</h3>

</figure>
<p>In the inactivated state the Na+ channel cannot be opened by further
  membrane depolarization. The inactivation can be reversed only by
  repolarizing the membrane to its negative resting potential, whereupon
  the channel switches to the resting state. This switch takes some time
  because channels leave the inactivated state relatively slowly.</p>
<p>Each Na+ channel has an <em>activation gate</em> that is closed while
  the membrane is at the resting potential and opened by depolarization.
  An <em>inactivation gate</em> is open at the resting potential and
  closes after the channel opens in response to depolarization. The
  channel conducts Na+ only for the brief period during depolarization
  when <em>both</em> gates are open. Repolarization reverses the two
  processes, closing the activation gate and then opening the inactivation
  gate.</p>

  Action Potential Can Be Reconstructed from the Properties of Sodium and
  Potassium Channels</h3>

<p>According to the Hodgkin-Huxley model an action potential involves
  the following sequence of events. Depolarization of the membrane causes
  Na+ channels to open rapidly (an increase in gNa), resulting in an
  inward Na+ current. This current, by discharging the membrane
  capacitance, causes further depolarization, thereby opening more Na+
  channels, resulting in a further increase in inward current. This
  regenerative process drives the membrane potential toward ENa, causing
  the rising phase of the action potential.2 The depolarization limits the
  duration of the action potential in two ways: (1) It gradually
  inactivates the voltage-gated Na+ channels, thus reducing gNa, and (2)
  it opens, with some delay, the voltage-gated K+ channels, thereby
  increasing gK. Consequently, the inward Na+ current is followed by an
  outward K+ current that tends to repolarize the membrane (Figure
  7-10).</p>
<p>In most nerve cells the action potential is followed by a
  hyperpolarizing after-potential, a transient shift of the membrane
  potential to values more negative than the resting potential. This brief
  negative change in Vm occurs because the K+ channels that open during
  the repolarizing phase of the action potential remain open for some time
  after Vm has returned to its resting value. It takes a few milliseconds
  for all of the K+ channels to return to the closed state. During this
  time, when the permeability of the membrane to K+ is greater than during
  the resting state, Vm is slightly greater (more negative) than its
  normal resting value, resulting in a Vm closer to EK (Figure 7-10).</p>
<p>The combined effect of this transient increase in K+ conductance and
  the residual inactivation of the Na+ channels (see Figure 7-10)
  underlies the absolute refractory period, the brief period of time
  following an action potential when it is impossible to elicit another
  action potential. As some K+ channels begin to close and some Na+
  channels recover from inactivation, the membrane enters the relative
  refractory period, during which it is possible to trigger an action
  potential, but only by applying stimuli that are stronger than those
  normally required to reach threshold. Together, these refractory periods
  typically last just 5-10 ms.</p>
<p>Two features of the action potential predicted by the Hodgkin-Huxley
  model are its threshold and all-or-none behavior. A fraction of a
  millivolt can be the difference between a subthreshold stimulus and a
  stimulus that generates a full-sized action potential. This all-or-none
  phenomenon may seem surprising when one considers that gNa increases in
  a strictly graded manner as depolarization increases (see Figure 7-7).
  Each increment of depolarization increases the number of voltage-gated
  Na+ channels that open, thereby gradually increasing INa. How then can
  there be a discrete threshold for generating an action potential?</p>
<p>Although a small subthreshold depolarization increases the inward
  INa, it also increases two outward currents, IK and Il, by increasing
  the electrochemical driving forces acting on K+, and Cl–. In addition,
  the depolarization augments gK by gradually opening more voltage-gated
  K+ channels (Figure 7-7). As the outward IK and Il increase with
  depolarization they repolarize the membrane and resist the depolarizing
  action of the Na+ influx. However, because of the high voltage
  sensitivity and more rapid kinetics of activation of the Na+ channels,
  the depolarization eventually reaches a point where the increase in
  inward INa exceeds the increase in outward IK and Il. At this point
  there is a net inward ionic current. This produces a further
  depolarization, opening even more Na+ channels, so that the
  depolarization becomes regenerative, driving the membrane potential all
  the way to the peak of the action potential. The specific value of Vm at
  which the net ionic current just changes from outward to inward,
  depositing a net positive charge on the inside of the membrane
  capacitance, is the threshold.</p>
<h3>The
  Nervous System Expresses a Rich Variety of Voltage-Gated Ion
  Channels</h3>
<p>Voltage-gated Na+, and K+ channels similar to those described by
  Hodgkin and Huxley have been found in almost every type of neuron
  examined. In addition, most neurons contain voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
  that open in response to membrane depolarization. A strong
  electrochemical gradient drives Ca2+ into the cell, so these channels
  give rise to an inward ICa that helps depolarize the cell.</p>
<p>Some neurons and muscle cells have voltage-gated Cl– channels that
  contribute to membrane repolarization. Many neurons have cation channels
  that are slowly activated by hyperpolarization (instead of the usual
  depolarization). These hyperpolarization-activated cation (or HCN)
  channels are permeable to both K+, and Na+, and have a reversal
  potential around –40 to –30 mV. As a result, they give rise to an inward
  depolarizing current, referred to as Ih, when the membrane repolarizes
  to negative resting potentials or becomes hyperpolarized during synaptic
  inhibition.</p>
<p>The squid axon can generate an action potential with just two types
  of voltage-gated channels. Why then are so many types of voltage-gated
  ion channels found in the nervous system? The answer is that neurons
  with a greater variety of voltage-gated channels have much more complex
  information-processing abilities than those with only two types of
  channels.</p>
<h3>Gating
  of Voltage-Sensitive Ion Channels Can Be Influenced by Various
  Cytoplasmic Factors</h3>
<p>In a typical neuron the opening and closing of certain voltage-gated
  ion channels can be modulated by various cytoplasmic factors, thus
  affording the neuron’s excitability properties greater flexibility.
  Changes in the levels of such cytoplasmic factors may result from the
  activity of the neuron itself or from the influences of other
  neurons.</p>
<p>Calcium concentration is one important cytoplasmic factor that
  modulates ion channel activity. The ionic current through membrane
  channels during an action potential generally does not result in
  appreciable changes in the intracellular concentrations of most ion
  species. Calcium is a notable exception to this rule. The concentration
  of free Ca2+ in the cytoplasm of a resting cell is extremely low, about
  10–7 M, several orders of magnitude below the external Ca2+
  concentration, which is approximately 2 mM. For this reason the
  intracellular Ca2+ concentration may increase many fold above its
  resting value as a result of the influx of Ca2+ through voltage-gated
  Ca2+ channels. The transient increase in Ca2+ concentration near the
  inside of the membrane enhances the probability that calcium-activated,
  voltage-sensitive K+ channels will open. Some Ca2+ channels are
  themselves sensitive to levels of intracellular Ca2+, becoming
  inactivated when incoming Ca2+ binds to their intracellular surface.
  Changes in the intracellular concentration of Ca2+ can also influence a
  variety of cellular metabolic processes, including neurotransmitter
  release and gene expression.</p>
<h3>Excitability
  Properties Vary Between Regions of the Neuron</h3>
<p>Dendrites in many types of neurons have voltage-gated ion channels,
  including Ca2+, K+, HCN, and Na+ channels. When activated, these
  channels help shape the amplitude, time course, and propagation of the
  synaptic potentials to the cell body. In some neurons action potentials
  may be propagated from the trigger zone at the initial segment of the
  axon back into the dendrites, thereby influencing synaptic integration
  in the dendrites. In other neurons the density of voltage-gated channels
  in the dendrites is sufficient to support the generation of a local
  action potential, which may then be conducted through the cell soma to
  the axon initial segment.</p>
<p>The trigger zone at the axon initial segment has the lowest threshold
  for action potential generation in part because it has an exceptionally
  high density of voltage-gated Na+ channels. In addition, it typically
  has voltage-gated ion channels that are sensitive to relatively small
  deviations from the resting potential. These channels thus play a
  critical role in the transformation of graded synaptic or receptor
  potentials into a train of all-or-none action potentials.</p>
<p>Moreover, both central and peripheral myelinated axons have fairly
  high densities of K+ channels under the myelin sheath near the two ends
  of each internodal segment. The normal function of these K+ channels is
  to suppress any action potential that may be generated by axon membrane
  under the myelin sheath. In demyelinating diseases these channels become
  exposed and thus inhibit the ability of the bare axon to conduct action
  potentials (see Chapter 6).</p>
<p>Presynaptic nerve terminals at chemical synapses commonly have a high
  density of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels. Arrival of an action potential
  in the terminal opens these channels, causing an influx of Ca2+ that
  triggers transmitter release (Chapter 12).</p>
<h3>Excitability
  Properties Vary Between Types of Neurons</h3>
<p>Two aspects of excitability are important: (1) control of the shape
  of the action potential and (2) spike encoding, the process by which
  receptor potentials or synaptic potentials are converted into a temporal
  pattern of action potentials. Both of these features vary widely between
  different types of neurons. Of the voltage-gated channels, the K+
  channels exhibit the greatest functional diversity. Differences in K+
  channel expression are a key factor in determining the distinctive
  excitability properties of different classes of neurons.</p>
<p>How a neuron responds to synaptic input is determined by the
  proportions of different types of voltage-gated channels in the cell’s
  input and integrative regions. For example, cells with different
  combinations of channels respond differently to a constant excitatory
  input. Some cells respond with only a single action potential, others
  with a train of action potentials at a constant rate of firing, and
  still others with either an accelerating or decelerating train of action
  potentials. The combined presence of certain voltage-gated Ca2+ channels
  and HCN channels generates pacemaker currents that allow some neurons to
  fire spontaneously in the absence of any external input (Figure
  7-11D).</p>
<p>The firing rate of most neurons saturates as the strength of synaptic
  input increases, with a maximal rate that is not particularly high.
  However, certain classes of neurons have an unusually wide dynamic range
  and are able to fire at very high frequencies because of an unusually
  brief refractory period. This high firing rate is of particular
  importance in the auditory system, where neurons must respond to sound
  waves of very high frequencies. The short refractory period is caused,
  in part, by the expression in the auditory neurons of the voltage-gated
  K+ channel Kv3, whose activation gates close extremely rapidly following
  repolarization, resulting in a very short hyperpolarizing
  after-potential.</p>

    The waveform of the ionic current traces in the figure is drawn to reflect the
    activation and inactivation of the underlying conductances during the
    slow subthreshold changes in membrane potential. In reality, the
    currents will also show rapid changes during any triggered action
    potentials because of large, rapid changes in driving
    force
